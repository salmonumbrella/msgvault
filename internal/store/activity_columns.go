// MessagesActivityColumns are the columns of `messages` the dated-activity
// projector reads: the candidate row (activityCandidateColumns in
// activity_queries.go) plus the sender/ownership inputs of its person
// derivation. Only a change to one of these can move a message's activity
// event, so only these fire trg_activity_queue_messages_update on both backends.
//
// Every other column stays out on purpose. Bookkeeping such as embed_gen,
// search_fts, indexing_version, and last_modified is rewritten archive-wide by
// embedding and FTS backfills; content the projector never reads (subject,
// snippet, attachment counters, read/delivery flags) is re-stamped by every
// sync. A blanket trigger turned each of those sweeps into a full re-projection
// — and because the stored event carries the row's last_modified, the
// projector could not even short-circuit them as unchanged — while the pending
// queue held the contact-state freshness barrier open until it drained.
//
// last_modified is excluded even though the projector records it as
// ProjectedLastModified: that value is "last_modified as of the inputs that
// were projected" and is only ever compared against a candidate token loaded
// in the same batch (validateActivityEventToken), never against the live row.
//
// TestMessagesActivityColumnsAreRealColumns keeps this list honest against the
// live table.

// fires on the columns a statement NAMES, and UpsertMessage's ON CONFLICT
