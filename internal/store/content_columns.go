// MessagesContentColumns are the columns of `messages` whose modification means
// the message changed in a way a reader must see again. This list drives the
// content_changed_at triggers on both backends.
//
// The invariant tying this list to the change feed is one-directional: every
// field ChangedMessage carries must appear here, EXCEPT id and
// content_changed_at (the immutable row ID and the watermark itself). Any other
// field the feed reports but the trigger ignores would be cached stale by a
// consumer forever. The converse does not hold. This list also covers columns
// the feed does not return — sender_id and metadata are tracked because
// changing either means "re-read this message", yet neither is in the response
// — and that is correct: tracking a column the feed omits costs a redundant
// re-read, while omitting a column the feed returns costs silent staleness.
//
// That direction is enforced by TestChangesResponseFieldsAreAllTracked
// (internal/api/changes_test.go), which reflects over the feed's HTTP response
// type and requires every field it carries to appear in this list. The response
// type arrives with the HTTP endpoint, later in this change, so the test is not
// in the tree at this commit; until it lands the direction is held by review
// against ChangedMessage. TestMessagesColumnClassificationIsExhaustive already
// asserts the other half — that every real column of `messages` is classified
// here or in MessagesNonContentColumns.
//
// last_modified is NOT this list. That column is a true row-level watermark
// that bumps on any change and stays that way -- the embed worker relies on it
// as an optimistic-CAS token. The two columns answer different questions.
//
// Adding a column to `messages` without classifying it here or in
// MessagesNonContentColumns fails TestMessagesColumnClassificationIsExhaustive.
