// sqliteQuiescentProbeTimeout is how long ReadWatermarkBounds waits for the

// costs only freshness, never correctness. SQLite write transactions are
// normally sub-millisecond, so 250ms times out only against a writer that is
// genuinely holding the lock — which is exactly the case where waiting longer
// would not have helped either.
//
// The probe is a WRITE-lock acquisition, so polling the feed costs the database
// writer throughput in a way an ordinary read does not: measured on one machine
// against three concurrent writers, eight clients paging the feed in a tight
// loop cut writes to 15% of the unloaded rate, where eight clients running an
// equivalent plain SELECT left 49%. One consumer polling once a second is free;
// a consumer that polls as fast as it can is competing with the importer for
// the write lock. Poll on an interval. Drain a backlog by asking for a bigger
// page, or by paging straight on from the last row's cursor while a full page
// keeps coming back — not by shortening the interval, which buys nothing but
// lock contention.

// ReadWatermarkBounds implements Dialect.
//
// SQLite has no pg_stat_activity: nothing exposes when another connection's
// write transaction began, or whether one is open at all. What it has instead
// is a single writer. Acquiring the write lock is therefore a proof rather than
// an observation — while this probe holds it, no other write transaction
// exists, so every content_changed_at stamp in the database has committed. The
// clock read inside that lock is a valid commit bound:
//
//   - A write that committed before the lock was acquired stamped itself
//     earlier still, so it is strictly below the reading (or equal to it, which
//     the page's strict `<` also excludes — a delay, not a loss).
//   - A write that starts after the probe releases the lock cannot be stamped
//     before it acquires the lock, which is after the reading.
//
// When the lock cannot be taken within sqliteQuiescentProbeTimeout, a writer is
// in flight and its start time is unknowable, so the bound falls back to the
// newest instant this dialect has already proved quiescent — the last probe
// that succeeded. That is always safe (any write in flight now began after it)
// and it is why the instant is remembered rather than recomputed: the fallback
// is the whole liveness story on SQLite. The feed then stops advancing until
// the writer finishes, and says so through the lag between CommitBound and Now.
// That lag is the age of the last successful probe, NOT the age of the writer
// in flight: probes run only when something reads the bound, so a writer that
// started a moment ago inherits the whole gap since the last quiet reading. It
// is an upper bound on the writer's age, which is the safe direction, but it is
// not a measurement of it — unlike PostgreSQL's, which reads xact_start.
//
// A fresh dialect that has never completed a probe reports the zero time, so
// the feed publishes nothing until it first sees the database idle. That is the
// honest answer — it has no evidence any stamp has committed — and it resolves
// on the first quiet moment.

// lastModifiedUpdateOfColumns renders every live column of `messages` EXCEPT

//
// last_modified is a blanket row-level watermark: it must move whenever any
// real column changes, so the list is "everything except", not a curated set.
// The one exclusion exists because SQLite triggers cannot assign to NEW, so
// trg_messages_content_changed_at stamps the watermark with a SECOND UPDATE of
// the row. A blanket AFTER UPDATE last_modified trigger fires on that stamp
// too, and because the stamp does not name last_modified its WHEN guard
// (OLD.last_modified = NEW.last_modified) holds — so it overwrites whatever
// last_modified the caller's original statement had just set by hand. That
// silently disarms ApplyMessageDateRepairs, whose CAS compares against exactly
// that written token. `UPDATE OF` matches on the columns a statement NAMES, so
// excluding content_changed_at excludes the stamp and nothing else.
// PostgreSQL needs none of this: it stamps in a BEFORE trigger, in place.

// MessagesNonContentColumns so it cannot drift from the real schema and so

// The names are read as SEPARATE VALUES and quoted individually, because they
// are interpolated into DDL and the ARCHIVE supplies them: SQLite accepts any
// text as a column name when it is quoted, so a name can itself be a second
// statement, and go-sqlite3 executes every statement in a string it is handed.
// A raw group_concat list therefore made any archive able to run arbitrary SQL
// at open. quoteIdentifier is the same contract commonColumns applies to the
// subset copy's column list: render every name quoted, doubling any quote
// inside it. commonColumns itself is not reusable here — it takes
// a *sql.Tx with a second schema ATTACHed and returns the intersection of the
// two, and neither exists on this path.
