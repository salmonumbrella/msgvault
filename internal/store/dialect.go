// WatermarkBounds is the pair of instants the content-change feed reads before
// every page. They answer two different questions and must not be conflated.
//
// Now is the database server's clock. It is what a consumer needs for overlap
// arithmetic against a watermark, and it is published as the page's
// server_time.
//
// CommitBound is the instant strictly below which every content_changed_at
// stamp made by a write the bound can see is already COMMITTED, and it is the
// page's upper bound. The distinction is the whole point: both backends stamp
// the watermark when the statement runs and publish the row when its
// transaction commits, so a row can carry a stamp the clock has already passed
// and still be invisible. Paging up to the clock parks the consumer's cursor
// above such a row, which then fails both arms of the keyset lower bound
// forever — measured at 40 of 40 tombstones lost from one PostgreSQL deletion
// run. Paging up to the oldest write that could still commit cannot: every
// uncommitted stamp is at or above that instant. The one write this cannot
// cover is a PostgreSQL prepared transaction, which holds its locks with no
// owning session and so exposes no start time to be the oldest. That residual
// and the feed's other exceptions are written up in docs/api-server.md; this
// comment names only the exception that bears on CommitBound and deliberately
// does not restate the list, because a list kept in two places drifts.
//
// CommitBound is never after Now, and while a write transaction is in flight it
// lags Now. That lag is the feature's cost: while a connection sits idle inside
// a transaction, the feed stops advancing. It is published (complete_through)
// so a stalled feed does not look like a caught-up one.
//
// The lag is the oldest in-flight write transaction's own age on PostgreSQL,
// which can read xact_start. SQLite cannot: its bound is the last instant the
// database was caught with its write lock free, so the lag there is the age of
// that proof, and a writer that started a moment ago inherits however long it
// had been since a probe last succeeded — including any stretch in which
// nothing read the bound at all. The two are not interchangeable when reading
// the number; see each dialect's ReadWatermarkBounds.
//
// A ZERO CommitBound is not an instant and no lag can be derived from it: it
// means no bound has been established at all, so nothing is known to have
// committed and the page is empty by construction. Only the SQLite dialect
// produces it, and only until its first successful probe (see
// SQLiteDialect.ReadWatermarkBounds). A dialect that cannot establish a bound
// it can TRUST returns an error instead, which is a different thing — see
