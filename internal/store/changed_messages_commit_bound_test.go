// It is the property the feed did not have. Both backends stamp
// content_changed_at when the statement runs and publish the row when its
// transaction commits, so bounding a page at the database clock lets the cursor
// settle above a change that has not appeared yet — and the keyset lower bound
// (`>= since AND (> since OR id > since_id)`) then excludes it on every future
// request. Measured before the fix: 40 of 40 tombstones lost from one
// PostgreSQL run of MarkMessagesDeletedFromReader, and rows lost on SQLite
// wherever a committed write shared a millisecond with an uncommitted one on a
// higher id.
//
// The page is now bounded below the oldest write that could still commit
// instead, which the store publishes as ChangedMessagePage.CompleteThrough.
