# Engineering records

These documents preserve design rationale, investigations, and implementation
plans. They are outside the public documentation build and are not current
operating instructions. A recorded proposal or task list does not establish
that a feature is implemented, approved, or scheduled.

For the current system, start with [architecture](../architecture/overview.md).
For maintenance rules, see the [documentation contributor guide](../README.md).

Retain recorded approvals, unresolved decisions, and exception-removal
conditions when updating these records. Consult current source and the owning
guide before acting on an old command, protocol shape, or implementation plan.
