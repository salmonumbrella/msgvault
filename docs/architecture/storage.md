title: Data Storage
description: Database schema, Parquet analytics cache, content-addressed attachments, and token storage.
---

The archive database preserves messages, source evidence, curated people, and
durable operation state. Attachment bytes are stored separately and shared by
content hash. Analytics and semantic indexes are derived from those records;
back up the archive and attachments before relying on a rebuild or local purge.

## Storage Layers

| Layer | Role | Location |
|---|---|---|
| SQLite | Default system of record | `~/.msgvault/msgvault.db` |
| PostgreSQL | Optional system of record | `[data].database_url` |
| SQLite vector index | Optional, rebuildable semantic index | `[vector].db_path`, default `~/.msgvault/vectors.db` |
| Parquet | Analytics cache | `~/.msgvault/analytics/` |
| Attachments | Content-addressed loose files and sealed packs | `~/.msgvault/attachments/` |
| Tokens | OAuth tokens and provider credentials | `~/.msgvault/tokens/` |

## Archive Database

Message metadata, bodies, labels, participants, raw payloads, and curated
profiles live in the configured archive database. Attachment bytes are stored
separately. SQLite is the default and stores the archive at `~/.msgvault/msgvault.db`. PostgreSQL is opt-in through `[data].database_url` and is intended for new archives or fresh re-syncs.

### Core Tables

**sources** -- Accounts and import sources with sync state.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | INTEGER PK | Auto-increment |
| `source_type` | TEXT | Provider/import type, for example `gmail`, `imap`, `gcal`, `teams`, `discord`, `beeper`, `mbox`, `whatsapp`, `granola`, `circleback`, `notion_meetings`, or `muesli` |
| `identifier` | TEXT | Provider-stable identifier such as an email address, phone number, or Discord guild ID |
| `display_name` | TEXT | Account display name |
| `sync_cursor` | TEXT | Sync cursor (Gmail history ID for Gmail accounts) |
| `last_sync_at` | DATETIME | Last sync timestamp |

**conversations** -- Email threads and chat conversations.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | INTEGER PK | Auto-increment |
| `source_id` | INTEGER FK | References `sources` |
| `source_conversation_id` | TEXT | Source-specific thread/conversation ID |
| `conversation_type` | TEXT | `email_thread`, `direct_chat`, `group_chat`, `channel`, or another provider-defined kind |
| `message_count` | INTEGER | Denormalized count |
| `last_message_at` | DATETIME | Latest message timestamp |

**messages** -- Message metadata. Foreign key to `conversations`.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | INTEGER PK | Auto-increment |
| `conversation_id` | INTEGER FK | References `conversations` |
| `source_id` | INTEGER FK | References `sources` |
| `source_message_id` | TEXT | Source-specific message ID |
| `message_type` | TEXT | `email`, `calendar_event`, `meeting_transcript`, `beeper`, `teams`, `discord`, `sms`, `mms`, `whatsapp`, `imessage`, `fbmessenger`, `synctech_sms_call`, `google_voice_text`, `google_voice_call`, `google_voice_voicemail` |
| `sent_at` | DATETIME | Send timestamp |
| `sender_id` | INTEGER FK | References `participants` |
| `subject` | TEXT | Message subject |
| `snippet` | TEXT | Preview excerpt |
| `size_estimate` | INTEGER | Approximate size in bytes |
| `has_attachments` | BOOLEAN | Attachment flag |
| `deleted_at` | DATETIME | Soft-delete timestamp |
| `deleted_from_source_at` | DATETIME | Records removal from the source; content may remain archived |

**message_bodies** -- Parsed content stored separately from message metadata.

`message_id` is both the primary key and a reference to `messages`; `body_text`
and `body_html` hold the parsed bodies. Keeping these large values separate
allows metadata scans without reading message content. Search uses the full-text
index; detail readers fetch bodies by message ID.

**message_raw** -- Raw provider payload storage, compressed with zlib.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `message_id` | INTEGER PK/FK | References `messages` |
| `raw_data` | BLOB | Compressed MIME or provider JSON data |
| `compression` | TEXT | `zlib` |
| `raw_format` | TEXT | Format discriminator, such as `mime` or `notion_meeting_json` |

Native Notion meetings use raw format `notion_meeting_json`. The compressed
envelope keeps provider discovery, structured blocks, page Markdown, minimized
resolved users, canonical text used for safe transcript preservation, and
hydration warnings. Integration tokens and authorization headers are never
part of the envelope.

**participants** -- Observed addresses and handles from source data. These are
separate from the curated `persons` table.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | INTEGER PK | Auto-increment |
| `email_address` | TEXT | Email address (unique index) |
| `phone_number` | TEXT | Phone number (for chat participants) |
| `display_name` | TEXT | Contact name |
| `domain` | TEXT | Extracted domain |

**message_recipients** -- From/To/Cc/Bcc mapping.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `message_id` | INTEGER FK | References `messages` |
| `participant_id` | INTEGER FK | References `participants` |
| `recipient_type` | TEXT | `from`, `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `mention`, or another provider-defined role |

**labels / message_labels** -- Source labels and imported mailbox/folder labels
(many-to-many).

| Table | Key Columns |
|---|---|
| `labels` | `id`, `source_id`, `source_label_id`, `name`, `label_type` |
| `message_labels` | `message_id`, `label_id` |

**attachments** -- Content-addressed attachment metadata.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | INTEGER PK | Auto-increment |
| `message_id` | INTEGER FK | References `messages` |
| `filename` | TEXT | Original filename |
| `mime_type` | TEXT | MIME type |
| `size` | INTEGER | Size in bytes |
| `content_hash` | TEXT | SHA-256 hash |
| `storage_path` | TEXT | Relative path: `ab/abcd1234...` |

**sync_runs / sync_run_items / sync_checkpoints / source_import_items** -- Sync and import state for resumability and diagnostics.

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sync_runs` | Track each sync operation (start, end, counts, errors) |
| `sync_run_items` | Track per-message fetch, ingest, delete, skip, and error outcomes inside a sync run |
| `sync_checkpoints` | Resume point per source (message ID, page token) |
| `source_import_items` | Track file/object-level imports from resumable adapters, including provider ID, checksum, status, and import errors |

Per-item sync diagnostics keep a failed message visible without hiding
successful work from the same run. Actionable item failures are recorded with
`status = 'error'`, `phase` values such as `fetch`, `ingest`, or `delete`, and
an `error_kind`/`error_message`. Expected churn, such as a Gmail message that
disappears before raw fetch, is recorded as `status = 'skipped'`.

`source_import_items.checksum` is nullable because some providers or legacy rows
may not have a stable checksum. msgvault treats a null checksum as an empty
string when checking already-imported source items.

### People, evidence, and operation state

| Table family | What it preserves |
|---|---|
| `persons`, `person_participants` | Durable profiles and their bindings to observed participants |
| `attribute_definitions`, `person_attribute_values` | Typed profile fields, values, and history |
| `organizations`, `employments`, `person_relationships` | Organization profiles, employment history, and dated relationships |
| `person_fact_*` | Evidence, claims, resolutions, decisions, and pins |
| `person_tracking`, `person_sweep_*` | Enrollment and progress for profile maintenance |
| `person_briefs`, `person_brief_evidence`, `person_brief_enrollments` | Saved conversation briefs, citations, and per-person enrollment |
| `person_inference_*`, `person_enrichment_*` | Provider profiles, checks, consent, external lookup state, and suppression |
| `carddav_*` | Address books, retained resources, publication, conflicts, and sync runs |
| `sync_runs` and worker run tables | Durable operation outcomes and progress behind Operations |

The current SQL schemas in `internal/store/schema.sql` and `schema_pg.sql` own
exact columns and constraints. [People guides](../usage/people.md) explain how
curation, evidence, and provider consent interact. These durable records are
not interchangeable with disposable analytics or semantic indexes.

### Full-Text Index

SQLite uses an FTS5 virtual table named `messages_fts`. PostgreSQL uses a `search_fts` `tsvector` column on `messages` with a GIN index.

Both power `msgvault search`, but the rankers differ. See [Search Ranking Across Backends](/docs/architecture/search-ranking/).

### Relationships

```
sources ─┬─< conversations ─< messages ─┬─< message_recipients ─> participants
         │                               ├─< message_labels ─> labels
         │                               ├── message_raw
         │                               └─< attachments
         └─< labels
```

## PostgreSQL Backend

PostgreSQL uses native types such as `BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`, `TIMESTAMPTZ`, `BYTEA`, and `JSONB`. Message, source, participant, label, attachment, and sync tables map to the same logical model as SQLite.

For semantic search, pgvector stores index generations, pending embedding work, and embedding vectors in the same PostgreSQL database. There is no separate `vectors.db` on PostgreSQL.

There is currently no SQLite to PostgreSQL migration command. Use PostgreSQL for a new archive or re-sync/import into an empty PostgreSQL database. See [PostgreSQL Backend](/docs/architecture/postgresql/) for setup and operational notes.

## Parquet (Analytics Cache)

The Web UI and TUI need to aggregate across your entire archive and return
results instantly as you group and drill down. On the default SQLite backend, msgvault exports denormalized metadata to
Parquet so DuckDB can group and filter it without repeatedly joining the
normalized archive tables.

Ungrouped Everything and Files listings page a scalar message or attachment
population before resolving participant lists for the returned rows. Exact
totals use separate narrow scans. This page-before-enrichment boundary keeps
multi-million-message listings inside the daemon's interactive DuckDB memory
budget without changing cache format or query semantics.

The Parquet cache is disposable and can be rebuilt at any time. The daemon
starts HTTP health and API routing before analytics cache maintenance, and
aggregate views never trigger a build mid-session. With
`auto_build_cache = true` (the default), a stale or missing cache is built in
the background after HTTP is ready. In `engine = "auto"`, aggregate views use
live SQL while that work runs and switch to DuckDB after the cache is ready and
opens successfully; a failed build or open keeps live SQL. In
`engine = "duckdb"`, analytics remain unavailable until the required cache is
ready, with no SQL fallback. While that automatic initialization is active,
cache-dependent Web UI views report that preparation is in progress and retry
until the cache becomes ready; terminal unavailable states retain the explicit
rebuild action. Set `auto_build_cache = false` to skip automatic startup
maintenance; scheduled syncs, ingest commands, and
`msgvault build-cache` can refresh or build the cache explicitly.

Each build writes and verifies a same-filesystem staging tree before publishing
under the exclusive cache lock. `_last_sync.json` is the commit marker: it is
invalidated before any live dataset changes and replaced last. A failure before
publication leaves the previous committed cache usable; interruption during
publication leaves the cache explicitly unavailable for repair, never marked
ready with mixed old and new datasets. Queries hold the lock shared, so a build
cannot replace Parquet files underneath an active reader. `msgvault
build-cache` builds or repairs the cache on demand. PostgreSQL archives use live
SQL for aggregate views rather than this Parquet acceleration layer.

The cache includes `relationship_activity`, `relationship_people`,
`relationship_domains`, and `relationship_daily` datasets. These compact edges
and rollups avoid expanding every message's participant list during people,
domain, relationship, timeline, and file-group queries. When a cache format changes, automatic cache building performs the required
rebuild during daemon startup. Run `msgvault build-cache --full-rebuild` to
request a full rebuild explicitly.

```bash
# Manual build
msgvault build-cache

# Full rebuild (discard existing)
msgvault build-cache --full-rebuild
```

Directory structure:

```
analytics/
├── messages/
│   ├── year=2020/
│   ├── year=2021/
│   └── ...
├── participants/
├── message_recipients/
├── labels/
├── attachments/
├── sources/
├── conversations/
├── message_labels/
├── relationship_activity/
├── relationship_people/
├── relationship_domains/
├── relationship_daily/
└── _last_sync.json
```

Messages are partitioned by year for efficient time-range queries. The cache omits full message bodies. Its size depends on message count,
participants, attachments, and the derived datasets included in the build.

## Content-Addressed Attachments

Every attachment from every message is identified by its SHA-256 content hash,
so identical bytes referenced by multiple messages are stored once. New
content is written as a loose file first; background maintenance and
`pack-attachments` move eligible loose objects into sealed immutable packs to
reduce file-count overhead. The archive can remain in a mixed state, and all
normal readers resolve loose and packed content transparently.

The attachment root can therefore contain both layouts:

```
attachments/
├── ab/
│   └── abcd1234567890...            # loose object: full SHA-256 name
├── packs/
│   └── 01/
│       └── 01k...mvpack             # sealed immutable pack
└── ...
```

Loose objects are sharded by the first two hash characters. Packed-object
locations and immutable pack totals are recorded in `attachment_pack_index`
and `attachment_packs`; loose objects have no pack-index row.

Use `pack-attachments` to migrate the eligible loose backlog immediately,
`repack-attachments` to reclaim dead space after content is removed, and
`unpack-attachments` to restore cataloged packed objects to loose files before
downgrading. The last command is local-only and requires the daemon to be
stopped because it removes production pack files. See the [CLI
reference](/docs/cli-reference/#pack-attachments) and [Backup](/docs/usage/backup/) guide
for maintenance and restore behavior.

Set `[data].loose_attachments = true` when file-oriented backup or storage
software requires stable individual attachment files. It prevents new packs,
rejects pack and repack commands, and restores backup content loose, but does
not convert existing packs automatically. Stop the daemon and run
`unpack-attachments` once if the existing archive must become fully loose.

## Token Storage

By default, OAuth tokens are stored as JSON files per account:

```
tokens/
├── personal@example.com.json
├── work@example.com.json
└── discord_<bot-user-id>.json
```

Token files are owner-only. Protect this directory: its credentials grant the
configured provider access. Discord bot records may be shared by several guild
sources through an optional binding label and are removed only after the last
referencing source is deleted.

Google credentials and tokens can use
[configured commands](/docs/configuration/#command-backed-google-credentials-and-tokens).
The external store owns the token JSON; the token directory holds coordination
locks. Other providers retain their file storage.

## Compression

| Data | Format | Ratio |
|---|---|---|
| Raw MIME | zlib in database BLOB/BYTEA | ~3-5x compression |
| Parquet | Snappy (DuckDB default) | ~10x vs raw SQLite |
| Attachments | Stored as-is (already compressed formats) | — |
