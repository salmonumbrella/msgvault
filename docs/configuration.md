## Config File

Default location:

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| **macOS / Linux** | `~/.msgvault/config.toml` |
| **Windows** | `C:\Users\<you>\.msgvault\config.toml` |

Override the data directory with the `MSGVAULT_HOME` environment variable or the `--home` flag (see below).

For a first archive, add only the sections required by your source. Optional
provider setup is covered in [recommended configuration](usage/recommended-configuration.md).
The [complete example](#example-configuration) below illustrates the available
sections; it is not a required starting configuration.


## Remote Deletion Consent

Starting in v0.20.0, remote deletion remains permanently opt-in. The invoking
CLI may enable it durably with `[deletion] remote_enabled = true` or for one
command with `MSGVAULT_ENABLE_REMOTE_DELETE=1`. Both mechanisms are permanent;
there is no planned automatic removal of the guardrail.

Consent belongs to the invoking CLI. When a command uses a remote daemon, the
CLI forwards its effective consent for that operation; the remote daemon's own
`[deletion]` section is not server policy for a command invoked elsewhere.
Staging, listing, inspecting, and dry-running deletion batches remain ungated.

## Choose optional processing

Use [recommended configuration](usage/recommended-configuration.md) for a guided
setup, then return here for exact keys and defaults. Each processing feature has
a separate scope and consent contract.

The defaults in this reference apply when a key is absent. They differ from the
values `setup providers` writes after confirmation: embeddings and people sweeps
start disabled, while setup can enable them and add schedules. Existing explicit
values remain in effect. Provider keys alone do not enable processing.

- [Profile automation](usage/people-automation.md): tracked people, sweep
  providers, budgets, and fact resolution.
- [Conversation briefs](usage/people-briefs.md): enrolled people and versioned
  summaries through the sweep provider.
- [External enrichment](usage/people-enrichment.md): Exa/SixtyFour policy setup,
  exact consent, request limits, and the persistent suppression key.
- [Document indexing](usage/document-indexing.md): extraction, document vectors,
  and separate query consent.
- [Vector search](usage/vector-search.md): text, person, and visual indexes.

## People sweep inference

People sweeps use one named protocol profile at a time. A profile records the
exact endpoint, model, wire protocol, negotiated output mode, privacy posture,
and source scope. It is configuration, not a provider preset. Msgvault never
changes the active profile or switches providers automatically.

```toml
[people.sweep]
enabled = true
provider = "glm"

[people.sweep.providers.glm]
protocol = "openai_chat"
endpoint = "https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4"
model = "glm-5.3"
auth = "bearer"
credential = "env"
credential_env = "ZAI_API_KEY"
output_mode = "prompt_json"
token_limit_parameter = "max_tokens"
reasoning_effort = "max"
request_timeout = "1m"
retention_posture = "provider-declared"
training_posture = "provider-declared"
allowed_sources = ["conversation_text", "meeting_text"]
source_since = "2026-01-01"
allow_sensitive = true
```

`allow_sensitive = true` is required for real sweeps: any packet that
carries seed or context evidence is marked sensitive, so a profile set to
`false` fails on every real sweep. `true` permits sending that verbatim
archive text to the selected provider; `false` leaves only the synthetic
capability check, which sends no archive text.

Usable protocols are `openai_chat`, `openai_responses`,
`anthropic_messages`, and `google_generate_content`. A fifth protocol,
`codex_app_server`, is defined but release-gated and cannot run yet; see the
Codex app-server profiles section below. Onboarding negotiates and saves
`native_json_schema`, `json_object`, or `prompt_json`. OpenAI Chat profiles
also save either `max_completion_tokens` or `max_tokens`; the other protocols
use their defined token-limit field.

These are examples of protocol profiles, not built-in presets:

| Example profile | Protocol | Typical profile choice |
|---|---|---|
| GLM 5.3 | `openai_chat` | Z.AI API base, `glm-5.3`, often `max_tokens` |
| Kimi K3 | `openai_chat` or `anthropic_messages` | Choose the exact API surface the account exposes |
| OpenRouter | `openai_chat` | OpenRouter API base and one explicit routed model ID |
| Venice | `openai_chat` | Venice API base and one explicit model ID |
| open-agent-api | `openai_chat` | The gateway's loopback API base and exposed model ID |
| Gemini | `google_generate_content` | Google API base and one Gemini model ID |
| Anthropic | `anthropic_messages` | Anthropic API base and one Claude model ID |
| OpenAI Responses | `openai_responses` | OpenAI API base and one Responses model ID |

Confirm current endpoints, model identifiers, privacy terms, and subscription
rules with the selected operator before saving a profile. OpenRouter and Venice
may route a request to another upstream operator, so the profile's retention
and training declarations must cover that full path. Logged-in or
subscription-backed endpoints, including local gateways, must be used within
their provider terms.

Credentials are not stored in this TOML. `credential = "stored"` keeps a
profile-specific secret under the private tokens directory and is supported
on Linux and macOS only; `credential = "env"` stores only the selected
environment-variable name and works everywhere.
`credential = "none"` is restricted to credentialless local or Codex paths.
Changing a credential value does not change the profile fingerprint, but
changing its source or reference does.

Only `msgvault person provider add` may contact models.dev, and only when a
transport field (`--protocol`, `--endpoint`, `--model`, `--auth`) is missing
or `--accept-catalog-prices` is set; it sends no archive data or provider
credential. `--custom` skips that catalog entirely; the required synthetic
check still contacts the endpoint selected in the profile. The catalog is never used
by scheduled or manual sweeps. A catalog suggestion also never chooses where a
credential is sent: onboarding pairs a credential only with an endpoint you
passed explicitly via `--endpoint` or with the first-party API hosts compiled
into msgvault, so a compromised catalog cannot redirect your key. A successful check does not grant consent:
`msgvault person provider consent <name> --yes` is a separate explicit step.
Live credential checks are optional developer or operator verification and are
never CI requirements.

### `[people.sweep]`

Enable model-assisted profile maintenance only after configuring, checking, and
consenting to a provider. A person must also be tracked before the sweep
maintains their facts. [Conversation briefs](usage/people-briefs.md) use this
same provider and schedule, with separate enrollment and interval controls.

| Key                      | Default      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`                | `false`      | Run the scheduled people sweep with the selected provider.                                                                                                                                         |
| `provider`               | `default`    | Name of a table under `[people.sweep.providers]`. The initial profile has an OpenAI endpoint but no model; it is not a usable, consented provider. Setup creates and selects `openai` or `ollama`. |
| `schedule`               | `15 2 * * *` | Daily at 02:15 in the daemon's time zone. An omitted or empty value receives this default; use `enabled = false` to disable the sweep.                                                             |
| `work_batch_size`        | `25`         | Tracked people considered in one worker batch.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `historical_message_cap` | `2000`       | Maximum archived messages considered when finding context for each profile field.                                                                                                                  |
| `context_per_target`     | `8`          | Maximum context items selected for each profile field.                                                                                                                                             |
| `evidence_max_bytes`     | `131072`     | Byte limit for an evidence packet.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `evidence_max_items`     | `200`        | Item limit for an evidence packet.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `backstop_interval`      | `24h`        | Interval before checking tracked people for changes missed by incremental work.                                                                                                                    |

`setup providers --allow-sensitive` uses `gpt-5.6-luna` with `medium` reasoning
when an OpenAI key is present, or the configured local Ollama chat model
otherwise. It preserves an existing active profile and never switches after a
request failure. Without `--allow-sensitive`, setup leaves inference pending:
the same profile flag controls both sensitive archive evidence and sensitive
attribute targets.

### `[people.sweep.budgets]`

Request and token limits apply to sweeps and briefs. Setup keeps these defaults;
it does not obtain provider prices or set a monetary limit.

| Scope      | Request key and default       | Input-token key and default            | Output-token key and default           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| One person | `max_requests_per_person = 4` | `max_input_tokens_per_person = 200000` | `max_output_tokens_per_person = 16000` |
| One run    | `max_requests_per_run = 100`  | `max_input_tokens_per_run = 1000000`   | `max_output_tokens_per_run = 160000`   |
| One day    | `max_requests_per_day = 500`  | `max_input_tokens_per_day = 5000000`   | `max_output_tokens_per_day = 800000`   |

`max_estimated_cost_microusd_per_run` and `max_estimated_cost_microusd_per_day`
both default to `0`, which disables those cost limits. To use either, supply
positive `input_cost_microusd_per_million_tokens` and
`output_cost_microusd_per_million_tokens`; both price assumptions also default
to `0`. Values are integer millionths of a US dollar. These are local estimates
from the prices you provide, not a provider billing limit.

### `[people.sweep.brief]`

Control how often enrolled people receive a "Last time we talked" brief and
how much text each generation uses. Briefs use the selected sweep provider and
share its budgets. The profile must permit sensitive content and include
`conversation_text` in `allowed_sources`.

Only supported chat and text-message sources supply brief evidence; email,
meeting transcripts, documents, and your own replies are excluded. See the
[brief guide](usage/people-briefs.md) for
supported sources and enrollment instructions.

Generation is enabled here by default, but each person must be enrolled
separately. These settings apply to everyone; there are no per-person overrides.
Restart the daemon after changing them.

```toml
[people.sweep.brief]
enabled = true
min_interval = "168h"
pre_call_window = "72h"
max_items = 40
max_bytes = 65536
overlap_items = 8
max_output_tokens = 2048
max_rendered_runes = 560
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Generate briefs for enrolled people when the sweep runs. `false` stops generation for everyone without removing enrollments. |
| `min_interval` | `168h` | Minimum age of the current version before a scheduled run regenerates it. A rejected current version counts as no brief and is replaced on the next eligible run. `msgvault person brief generate` bypasses this. Must be positive. |
| `pre_call_window` | `72h` | Regenerate this far ahead of a due contact cadence, so the brief is current before you reach out. Must be positive. |
| `max_items` | `40` | Maximum archive items admitted to one brief window. Must be positive. |
| `max_bytes` | `65536` | Maximum packet size for one brief window. Must be positive. |
| `overlap_items` | `8` | Items already covered by the previous brief's window that may be re-admitted so a continued thread is recognizable. Must not be negative or exceed `max_items`. |
| `max_output_tokens` | `2048` | Output cap for the brief call. Must be positive and must not exceed `[people.sweep.budgets] max_output_tokens_per_person`, because a brief is one more call against the same per-person ceiling. |
| `max_rendered_runes` | `560` | Maximum length of the rendered paragraph, in Unicode runes. Msgvault enforces it after the model answers by dropping structured items from the tail: uncertainties first, then follow-ups, then highlights, never the last-interaction sentence and never mid-sentence. Every dropped item is counted in the version's `dropped_item_count`, and the stored structure and evidence pointers are the trimmed ones. Must be at least 240, which is the interaction summary's own maximum length. |

An invalid value fails configuration validation with the offending key named,
rather than being clamped.

### Codex app-server profiles

The `codex_app_server` protocol is not usable in this release. Its transport
stays unavailable until the executable isolation gate releases a verified
build, and until then every Codex operation fails closed with
`codex app-server isolation is not released`. The profile shape is documented
here so the configuration is ready when the gate ships.

`codex_app_server` profiles are also the one protocol `person provider add`
cannot create: generic onboarding negotiates HTTP capabilities through an
endpoint, while codex_app_server has no endpoint to negotiate against and
runs through an attested local Codex executable instead. The following is
a reference shape for that gated implementation, not a working setup procedure:

```toml
[people.sweep.providers.codex]
protocol = "codex_app_server"
model = "gpt-5.3-codex"
auth = "none"
credential = "none"
reasoning_effort = "medium"
retention_posture = "zero_retention"
training_posture = "no_training"
allowed_sources = ["conversation_text"]
source_since = "2026-01-01"
allow_sensitive = true
```

`endpoint` is not allowed, and `auth` and `credential` must both be set to
`"none"`: the transport is the local Codex app server, authenticated by its
own ChatGPT login. Sensitivity policy is protocol-agnostic: real Codex sweeps
send the same seed and context packets, so `allow_sensitive = true` is
required here as well. Login, model discovery, checks, and consent cannot make
this profile usable while the release gate is closed. Use one of the available
HTTP protocols for current [profile automation](usage/people-automation.md).

### Windows Paths

TOML treats backslashes inside double-quoted strings as escape characters. On Windows, this means native paths like `"C:\Users\you\..."` will cause a parse error.

Use one of these formats instead:

```toml
# Forward slashes (recommended)
client_secrets = "C:/Users/you/Downloads/client_secret.json"

# Single-quoted string (backslashes are literal)
client_secrets = 'C:\Users\you\Downloads\client_secret.json'
```

## Sections

`msgvault setup providers` writes recommended values for the `[vector]`,
`[attachments.documents]`, and `[people.sweep]` sections from the API keys in
your environment, and `msgvault setup status` reports every lane with its
provider, model, consent state, and next step. The values it chooses are
listed in [Recommended Configuration](/docs/usage/recommended-configuration/).

### `[data]`

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `data_dir` | `~/.msgvault` | Base directory for all data |
| `export_dir` | `{data_dir}/exports` | Directory for attachment ZIPs, downloads, and files opened from the TUI |
| `database_url` | `{data_dir}/msgvault.db` | SQLite database path or PostgreSQL DSN |
| `loose_attachments` | `false` | Keep attachments as loose files and reject pack/repack commands instead of creating immutable packs |

Attachments and OAuth tokens are stored in subdirectories of `data_dir` (`attachments/` and `tokens/` respectively). These paths are not independently configurable.

Setting `loose_attachments = true` prevents new pack files but does not
convert existing packs. Stop the daemon and run `msgvault unpack-attachments`
once to materialize their contents as loose files. Backup restore also restores
attachments loose while this setting is enabled.

### `[attachments.documents]`

Hosted extraction and local full-text indexing for standalone document
attachments. It is disabled by default. Enabling it does not grant consent or
send data: an operator must generate an authenticated capability manifest and
record consent for the exact effective policy before a build can upload a
document.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Allow explicit document extraction commands |
| `provider` | `mistral` | Pinned extraction provider |
| `region` | `eu` | Pinned provider region and EU endpoint |
| `api_key_env` | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | Environment variable containing the provider key |
| `model` | `mistral-ocr-4-0` | Pinned OCR model |
| `retention_posture` | `unknown` | Confirmed provider posture: `standard` or `zdr` |
| `training_posture` | `unknown` | Confirmed provider posture: `default-opt-out` or `opted-out` |
| `max_file_bytes` | `52428800` | Maximum original document size (50 MiB) |
| `max_pages_per_document` | `500` | Maximum provider units for one document |
| `max_response_bytes` | `67108864` | Maximum provider response size (64 MiB) |
| `max_normalized_chars` | `25000000` | Maximum locally retained normalized characters |
| `max_spool_bytes` | `536870912` | Maximum private staging-directory usage (512 MiB) |
| `min_free_space_bytes` | `1073741824` | Free space preserved before staging (1 GiB) |
| `request_timeout` | `5m` | Timeout for each provider request attempt |
| `max_retries` | `3` | Maximum transient retries |
| `max_pages_per_run` | `10000` | Conservative provider-unit budget for one run |
| `max_estimated_cost_usd_per_run` | `50` | Cost-planning ceiling for one run |
| `estimated_cost_usd_per_1000_units` | `0` | Operator-supplied current price assumption; zero disables cost calculation |
| `pricing_assumption_on` | — | Date for the price assumption, in `YYYY-MM-DD` form |

#### CSV conversion

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Convert standalone `text/csv` attachments locally to PDF before the authorized PDF upload; disabled conversion leaves raw CSV outside the provider-authorized scope |

CSV conversion uses Docbank's default record, cell, cell byte, and PDF limits,
tightened by the configured original file, response, and page ceilings. The
generated PDF is transient. The archive keeps the original CSV hash and MIME
type plus the conversion receipt and page, record, and cell provenance. The
conversion declaration participates in the exact consent fingerprint only when
enabled.

Provider uploads are manual-only: `msgvault serve` does not schedule document
extraction. Each `documents build` or `documents resume` receives its capability
manifest explicitly and displays its upload and cost preflight before requiring
`--yes`. When document indexing is enabled, the daemon's weekly reconciliation
and local derivative cleanup remain automatic and make no provider requests.

`[attachments.documents.scope]` accepts `message_types`; an empty list includes
all supported standalone attachment sources. The first release requires
`[attachments.documents.index].lexical = true` and `store_chunk_text = true`.
Hosted document embeddings are not enabled by this configuration.

Enable document vectors separately with
`[attachments.documents.index.embeddings] enabled = true`, an enabled text
embedding provider, and distinct consents for document text and query text.
They use `[vector.embed.schedule]` for automatic embedding of already extracted
document chunks. That schedule never extracts new attachments. Setup enables
this subtable when both document extraction and a supported text provider are
selected, but leaves the two consent steps to you.

See [Document Attachment Indexing](/docs/usage/document-indexing/) for the complete
probe, consent, build, and recovery flow.

### `[oauth]`

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `client_secrets` | — | Path to Google OAuth `client_secret.json` for browser OAuth flows |
| `service_account_key` | — | Path to a Google service account key JSON for Workspace domain-wide delegation |

#### `[oauth.apps.<name>]`

Named OAuth apps for Google Workspace organizations that require their own OAuth credentials. Each entry can define a separate browser OAuth `client_secret.json`, service account key, or both. Use `--oauth-app <name>` with `add-account` to bind an account to a named app.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `client_secrets` | — | Path to the org's `client_secret.json` |
| `service_account_key` | — | Path to the org's Google service account key JSON |

See [OAuth Setup: Google Workspace Accounts](/docs/guides/oauth-setup/#google-workspace-accounts) for when and why you need named apps.

Discord's `--oauth-app` value is only a protected bot-token binding label. It
is not resolved from this section and does not require an `[oauth.apps]` entry.
`export-messages` uses the same daemon and database configuration as other
archive commands. It does not load provider credentials or make provider API
calls. The older `export-discord` compatibility command has the same read-only
provider behavior.

When `service_account_key` is configured, `msgvault add-account <email>` validates the delegated Gmail profile and registers the account without storing a per-user refresh token. The service account key file must be owner-only on Unix-like systems, for example `chmod 600 /path/to/service-account.json`.

### `[carddav]`

Connect through the [CardDAV account workflow](usage/people-carddav.md) so the
daemon validates discovery before saving these settings.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | `""` | Empty for a password-based server, or `google` for Google Contacts |
| `oauth_app` | `""` | Named Google OAuth app; empty selects `[oauth]` |
| `base_url` | `""` | CardDAV discovery URL; Google setup supplies its canonical URL |
| `username` | `""` | Server username or Google account email |
| `schedule` | `""` | Cron schedule; empty disables scheduled sync |
| `enabled` | `false` | Enable the configured connection |
| `trusted_origin` | `""` | Exact HTTPS origin approved for private access, including its port; a trailing `/` is accepted. Applies only when it matches the account URL's origin. |
| `trusted_addresses` | `[]` | Private IP addresses to dial for `trusted_origin`, without DNS. Accepts `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `100.64.0.0/10`, and `fc00::/7`; rejects duplicates, IPv6 zones, loopback, and link-local addresses. |

Set both trusted-destination keys together. See the
[private-server setup](usage/people-carddav.md#private-servers) for an example,
restart requirements, and behavior when the origin does not match.

Passwords and Google tokens stay in the configured token directory, outside
`config.toml`. See [Google Contacts setup](usage/people-carddav.md#google-contacts)
for browser and terminal authorization.

### `[microsoft]`

Configuration for Microsoft 365 / Outlook.com OAuth and Microsoft Teams Graph
sync. Required only if you use `add-o365`, `add-teams`, or `sync-teams`.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `client_id` | — | Azure AD Application (client) ID (required) |
| `redirect_uri` | `http://localhost:8089/callback/microsoft` | OAuth redirect URI registered in the Azure AD app |
| `tenant_id` | `common` | Azure AD tenant ID; `common` allows both personal and org accounts |

See [OAuth Setup: Microsoft 365](/docs/guides/oauth-setup/#microsoft-365-outlook-hotmail) for app registration steps. Teams uses the same `client_id` but requests Microsoft Graph scopes and stores tokens under `tokens/teams_<email>.json`; Outlook/Hotmail IMAP OAuth uses `tokens/microsoft_<email>.json`.

### `[[fastmail]]`

Optional source-scoped Fastmail JMAP identity inventory. This does not replace
IMAP ingestion credentials: add and sync the mailbox normally, then use the API
token only to discover masked and send-as addresses that belong to that source.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `source_id` | — | Positive numeric archive source ID; mutually exclusive with `account` |
| `account` | — | Unambiguous source identifier or display name; mutually exclusive with `source_id` |
| `api_token` | (required) | Fastmail API token used for the JMAP identity inventory |
| `auto_confirm_identities` | `false` | Refresh and apply strong provider identity evidence after successful mailbox syncs |

Exactly one source selector is required. Prefer `source_id` when two sources
share an identifier or display name. With automatic confirmation disabled,
`msgvault identity discover --source-id <id> --provider` fetches the inventory
for an explicit preview; add `--apply` only after reviewing it. See [People,
Profiles, and Source Identities](/docs/usage/people/#fastmail-alias-inventory).

### `[discord]`

Provider-wide Discord import settings and optional message-container filters.
Register guilds and store their bot credential first with `msgvault
add-discord`; tokens and binding labels do not belong in `config.toml`.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `max_media_bytes` | `52428800` (50 MiB) | Maximum size of one Discord attachment downloaded during sync or backfill |
| `max_media_mb` | — | Same cap in MiB; when set it takes precedence over `max_media_bytes` |
| `media` | `true` | Download attachment bytes at all |
| `media_scope` | `all` | Which conversations collect media: `all`, `direct` (direct and group chats only), or `none` |
| `media_max_participants` | `20` | Skip media from conversations with more participants than this; `0` disables the cap. See [Media policy](#media-policy) |
| `edit_rescan_window` | `168h` (seven days) | Trailing per-channel/thread window refreshed for edits, deletions, and reaction summaries |

Use an exact guild ID for a per-guild filter block. The same block also takes
the per-account media overrides (`media`, `max_media_mb`) that the other chat
providers put under `accounts_config`:

```toml
[discord.guilds."123456789012345678"]
include = ["456789012345678901"]
exclude = ["567890123456789012"]
# media = false
# max_media_mb = 25
```

An empty `include` means every accessible text or announcement channel, thread,
and forum post. Top-level channels match directly. A child inherits its
parent's state unless its own ID appears explicitly. An explicit child include
can override an excluded parent; an explicit child exclude can override an
included parent. `exclude` wins when the same ID is in both lists. See
[Discord](/docs/usage/discord/#configure-media-repairs-and-channel-filters).

### Media policy

`[beeper]`, `[slack]`, `[discord]`, and `[teams]` share one attachment policy
vocabulary. It decides which chat media is downloaded during sync and backfill;
message text is always archived.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `media` | `true` | Download attachment bytes. `false` archives messages without their media and records a `policy_scope` skip marker |
| `media_scope` | `all` | `all` collects from every conversation; `direct` collects only from direct and group chats (not channels, rooms, or guild channels); `none` collects nothing |
| `media_max_participants` | `20` | Skip media from conversations with more participants than this. Omitting the key applies the default; an explicit `0` removes the cap |
| `max_media_mb` | `250` (Discord `50`) | Per-attachment size cap in MiB. Sized for long voice notes, screen recordings, and phone video from direct chats now that the participant cap keeps large-room volume out |
| `accounts_config` | — | Per-account overrides of `media` and `max_media_mb`, keyed by Beeper accountID, Slack team ID, or Teams account email. Discord uses `[discord.guilds."<id>"]` instead |

The participant cap exists because most attachment bytes in a real chat
archive come from large rooms whose forwarded videos nobody wants kept. Direct
chats and small groups keep their photos, voice notes, and files. A skipped
occurrence is recorded with a typed marker (`participant_threshold`,
`policy_scope`, `account_policy`, or `size_cap`) that distinguishes a
deliberate skip from a failed download, so the `backfill-*-media` commands do
not retry it unless the policy changes.

```toml
[beeper]
media_scope = "all"
media_max_participants = 20
max_media_mb = 250

# Keep everything from one account regardless of room size or size cap.
[beeper.accounts_config.signal]
media = true
max_media_mb = 500

# Never download from another account.
[beeper.accounts_config.telegram]
media = false
```

Policy changes apply to future downloads. Media already stored under an
earlier policy stays until you run `msgvault purge-excluded-media`, which
removes attachment bytes the current policy would no longer collect.

### `[log]`

Structured file logging. Disabled by default. Enable it to get persistent, machine-readable logs for troubleshooting. Every CLI invocation writes a unique `run_id` on every log line so you can trace a single run across shared daily log files.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Turn on persistent file logging. Setting `dir` also enables it implicitly. |
| `dir` | `<data_dir>/logs` | Directory for log files |
| `level` | `info` | Log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `sql_trace` | `false` | Log every SQL query at info level (verbose, for debugging) |
| `sql_slow_ms` | `100` | Threshold in ms above which SQL queries are logged at warn level. `0` uses the built-in default (100 ms). |

Log files are named `msgvault-YYYY-MM-DD.log` (UTC date), written as newline-delimited JSON. When a daily log exceeds 50 MiB it rotates to `.log.1`, `.log.2`, etc. (up to 5 rotated files).

When SQL logging is enabled, slow/error entries include query arguments and streaming query durations, which makes it easier to diagnose expensive reads without enabling full trace output.

Use `msgvault logs` to view and tail log files from the selected local or remote daemon. See [CLI Reference: logs](/docs/cli-reference/#logs).

### `[sync]`

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `rate_limit_qps` | `5` | Gmail API requests per second |
| `archive_remote_images` | `false` | Download remote email images during Gmail/IMAP sync and EML, EMLX, MBOX, and PST imports |
| `trusted_imap_sent_mailboxes` | `{}` | Per-IMAP-account Sent-folder names (keyed by the ACCOUNT identifier from `msgvault list-accounts`) that enable edited-copy snapshot refresh for servers without advertised special-use roles |

Remote image archiving is **off by default**. Enabling it contacts
sender-controlled servers and can activate tracking pixels or disclose the
archive server's IP address. Restart the daemon after changing the setting.
It applies to new ingestion; existing mail needs an explicit backfill.

See [remote email images](usage/remote-images.md) for the opt-in workflow,
supported formats, download limits, and effect on attachment counts.

`trusted_imap_sent_mailboxes` names each IMAP account's Sent folder for
servers — such as some Exchange/Outlook accounts — whose (possibly localized)
Sent folder advertises no RFC 6154 `\Sent` special-use role. A survivor copy in
that unadvertised folder never replaces the archived snapshot by default:
the sync adopts the surviving location but keeps the previously archived
body, raw MIME, recipients, and attachments, because a sender can forge any
RFC822 `Message-ID`. Placement the server does advertise — an unambiguous
`\Sent` or `\Drafts` role — remains trusted automatically regardless of
this setting. Naming a mailbox here states that it is that account's Sent
folder and holds only mail the account itself authored, which re-enables
refreshing the archived snapshot from an edited copy found there.

The mapping is keyed by the exact source identifier — copy the `ACCOUNT`
value printed by `msgvault list-accounts` (for example
`imaps://user@example.com@imap.example.com:993`), not the email or display
name. Trust never crosses accounts: a same-named mailbox in another synced
account stays untrusted, and an account with no entry has no explicit trust.

```toml
[sync]
trusted_imap_sent_mailboxes = { "imaps://user@example.com@imap.example.com:993" = ["Gesendete Elemente"] }
```

This is an explicit trust assumption, not evidence: filters or IMAP rules
that file received mail into the listed mailbox would let that mail replace
an archived snapshot under the same Message-ID. Advertised unambiguous
`\Sent` and `\Drafts` placement is trusted automatically, and a mailbox
that carries `\All`, `\Junk`, or `\Trash` roles, or INBOX, is never
trusted — not even when listed here explicitly. A configured name the server
itself advertises as `\Drafts` keeps its Drafts meaning: explicit
configuration cannot turn a Drafts folder into the account's Sent folder.

### `[server]`

Settings for the Web UI and API server started by `msgvault serve`. The same HTTP server is used by remote CLI access and by the local background daemon for archive-access CLI commands. The `api_key` setting is also reused for inbound bearer authentication when `msgvault mcp --http` starts a separate Streamable HTTP listener; that listener's address comes from the `--http` flag. See [Web UI & API Server](/docs/api-server/) for API endpoint documentation and [MCP Server](/docs/usage/chat/#streamablehttp-transport) for MCP client setup, or fetch `/openapi.json` from a running server for the generated OpenAPI contract.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `api_port` | `0` (auto-select) | Port the server listens on; `0` picks an open port at startup and clients discover it automatically. Set a fixed port for remote/NAS deployments. |
| `bind_addr` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address |
| `api_key` | — | API key for daemon/API authentication and bearer authentication on `msgvault mcp --http` |
| `agent_access` | `false` | Enable restricted agent grants; requires `api_key` to be non-empty. Read at daemon startup only; a `config.toml` edit takes effect only after a restart. |
| `allow_insecure` | `false` | Allow non-loopback binding without `api_key` |
| `cors_origins` | `[]` | Allowed CORS origins |
| `cors_credentials` | `false` | Allow credentials in CORS requests |
| `cors_max_age` | `0` | CORS preflight cache duration in seconds |
| `trusted_proxies` | `[]` | IP addresses or CIDRs allowed to supply forwarded HTTPS/host headers |
| `daemon_idle_timeout` | `20m` | Idle timeout for lifecycle-managed background daemons; set to `"0s"` to disable |
| `daemon_auto_restart` | `newer` | Local daemon restart policy when the CLI finds a different daemon binary version: `newer`, `never`, or `always` |
| `daemon_auto_start` | `true` | Let CLI, TUI, and MCP commands start a local background daemon when none is running; set `false` when a supervisor runs `msgvault serve` |

`daemon_idle_timeout` applies only to background daemons started by `msgvault daemon start` or auto-started by a CLI command. Foreground `msgvault serve` keeps running until stopped. `MSGVAULT_DAEMON_IDLE_TIMEOUT` overrides the configured value for lifecycle-managed background daemons.

`daemon_auto_restart = "newer"` replaces an older compatible local daemon with the current CLI binary. Use `"never"` when another supervisor owns the daemon lifecycle, or `"always"` to restart whenever the recorded daemon version differs. Remote servers are never auto-restarted by a CLI client.

`daemon_auto_start = false` is for installs where a supervisor such as launchd, systemd, or Docker runs `msgvault serve`. Local archive commands then use the daemon that is already running, wait for one that is still starting, and otherwise fail with an error instead of starting their own. They also never replace a running daemon, whatever `daemon_auto_restart` says, because the supervisor owns restarts. `msgvault daemon start`, `msgvault daemon restart`, and the restart after `msgvault update` still start a daemon when you run them. Commands routed to `[remote].url` are unaffected.

Browser sessions are additive to API-key authentication. Existing CLI and
programmatic clients continue to send the configured key. For remote browser
access, terminate TLS at a reverse proxy and list that proxy—not arbitrary
clients—in `trusted_proxies`. See [Web UI](/docs/web-ui/) for the complete security
model and the plain-HTTP warning.

For MCP Streamable HTTP, send `[server].api_key` as `Authorization: Bearer
<key>` on every `/mcp` request. This inbound credential is independent of
`[remote].api_key`, which authenticates `msgvault mcp` when it connects to a
remote daemon.

### `[web]`

Defaults for the daemon-served browser application. These values can also be
changed from Settings; `config.toml` remains authoritative.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `default_search_mode` | `full_text` | Initial mode: `full_text`, `semantic`, or `hybrid` |
| `theme` | `system` | Color theme: `system`, `light`, or `dark` |
| `density` | `compact` | Table density: `compact` or `comfortable` |

Browser-managed settings are validated and written with optimistic concurrency.
Only the `[web]` keys apply right away; every other `config.toml` category takes
effect after the daemon restarts, and the Settings page says so once per
category. Two things saved from the Settings page are not `config.toml` rows and
apply right away: person-enrichment provider API keys, and the CardDAV account,
which has its own save action. A "Saved. Restart the daemon" banner means the
file is saved but the running daemon still has its old value. Changing `server.api_key` requires a confirmation and takes
effect only after restart, which also invalidates browser sessions.

### `[integrations.tasks]`

Optional provider-neutral integration for message-to-task links. Person agendas
use the separate Kata connection below.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Enable discovery and capability checks |
| `endpoint` | — | Explicit loopback HTTP, Unix socket, or HTTPS endpoint; empty requests secure local discovery |
| `api_key` | — | Server-side credential; the browser sees only a masked hint of it, never the key |
| `default_project` | `msgvault` | Fixed project used for create/link/search operations |

Remote plaintext HTTP is rejected. An endpoint is usable only when it supports
the required idempotency and compare-and-swap capabilities; the UI distinguishes
disabled, authentication required, incompatible, partial, stale, unavailable,
and ready states.

### `[integrations.kata]`

Optional live person agendas backed by Kata. Tasks stay in Kata; msgvault shows
their current state when you open a person's agenda. This integration is built
against Kata v0.18.0 and requires Kata API schema version 0.21.0 or later.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Enable Kata person agendas |
| `endpoint` | — | Required when enabled: an explicit HTTPS URL, loopback HTTP URL, or Unix socket URL |
| `api_key` | — | Bearer credential sent by the daemon to Kata; Settings returns only its configured state and a masked hint |
| `default_project` | `msgvault` | Existing active Kata project used for person agendas |

Create the project in Kata, then configure its endpoint and credential on the
machine running the msgvault daemon:

```toml
[integrations.kata]
enabled = true
endpoint = "https://kata.example.com"
api_key = "replace-with-your-kata-api-key"
default_project = "msgvault"
```

Restart the msgvault daemon after saving. These settings are also editable in
Settings and take effect after restart. Changing the endpoint to a different
origin in Settings clears its saved key unless you provide a replacement key
in the same save. Remote plaintext HTTP is rejected. Kata does not use local
endpoint discovery, and `[integrations.tasks]` does not configure person agendas.

Each Kata task can belong to one person. The scalar metadata value
`msgvault.person` is the person's canonical vCard UID, not their numeric
msgvault person ID. `msgvault.list` names its list and defaults to `agenda`.
Reads and unlink operations also recognize the person's UID aliases after a
merge.

Agendas show open tasks only, with at most 100 returned items. A `truncated`
response means more remain; open Kata to see them. The transport also limits
each response to 1 MiB and reports an error when it exceeds that limit.
Create, link, move between lists, and unlink tasks through msgvault; edit task
content or priority, complete tasks, and reopen them in Kata. See
[person agenda commands](cli-reference.md#person-agenda).

### `[analytics]`

Settings for daemon-side aggregate query behavior. The Web UI, TUI, MCP server, and aggregate list commands use these settings through the local daemon or a configured remote server.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `engine` | `auto` | Aggregate engine: `auto` starts with live SQL and switches to DuckDB after cache maintenance succeeds; `sql` always uses live SQL; `duckdb` requires a usable Parquet cache |
| `auto_build_cache` | `true` | Build a stale or missing Parquet cache during daemon startup and after scheduled syncs; `false` skips both automatic paths |
| `min_rebuild_interval` | `0s` | Minimum age of a usable cache before a scheduled sync or daemon restart may rebuild it; zero preserves rebuilding after each sync |
| `builder_memory_limit` | `2GB` | DuckDB memory limit for cache builds, such as `4GB` or `512MiB` |
| `builder_threads` | min(CPUs, 2) | DuckDB threads for cache builds; zero keeps the default |
| `builder_temp_limit` | `32GB` | Maximum spill-to-disk size for cache builds |
| `query_memory_limit` | `512MB` | DuckDB memory limit for daemon aggregate queries; raise it on a large archive |
| `query_threads` | min(CPUs, 4) | DuckDB threads for daemon aggregate queries; zero keeps the default |
| `query_temp_limit` | `2GB` | Maximum spill-to-disk size for daemon aggregate queries; a query that spills past it fails with a DuckDB out-of-memory error |

If a Web UI query runs out of memory or temporary disk space, its error names
the query-limit settings above. Try filters that narrow the results. On the
machine running msgvault, check available memory and free disk space before
raising these limits in `config.toml`. Restart the daemon to apply the change,
then retry the query. The limits cap resource use; they do not reserve memory
or disk space. Cache builds have separate `builder_*` limits.

The daemon starts HTTP health and API routing before analytics cache
maintenance. With `engine = "duckdb"`, analytics remain unavailable until a
usable cache is ready. If no usable cache can be built or opened, `msgvault serve`
fails instead of silently falling back. A failed automatic refresh keeps serving
the last usable publication. With `auto_build_cache = false`, use
`msgvault build-cache` for explicit cache maintenance. Deprecated in 0.17.0:
per-command analytics flags such as `msgvault tui --force-sql`,
`msgvault mcp --force-sql`, `msgvault tui --no-cache-build`, and
`--no-sqlite-scanner` were replaced by this daemon-level section. Use
`engine = "sql"` to force live SQL.

`min_rebuild_interval` limits automatic rebuilds after syncs and at daemon
startup. A restart, or a sync, within the interval leaves the existing
publication in service and schedules one rebuild check for when the interval
ends, so the cache refreshes even if no later sync arrives. A busy archive can
therefore serve Parquet analytics that lag SQLite by approximately the
configured interval plus cache build time. Explicit `msgvault build-cache`
requests, query-required builds, and recovery of an absent, interrupted,
incompatible, or otherwise unusable cache are not delayed.

The daemon runs automatic rebuilds in the background, outside the scheduled
sync that requested them, so syncs keep their cadence while a build runs. A
sync that finishes during a build does not discard it: the build publishes
what it exported and marks the cache so the next build is a full rebuild.
This partial snapshot remains usable across daemon restarts, and its next
automatic rebuild still honors `min_rebuild_interval`.
Cache build memory and temporary disk usage scale with archive size, so a
minimum interval can prevent repeated archive-scale work when sources sync
frequently. Changes under `[analytics]` take effect after the daemon restarts.

This setting governs the aggregate views (Senders/Domains/Labels/Time) and is ignored entirely when `[data].database_url` points at PostgreSQL — a PostgreSQL backend always uses live SQL for those views, and `build-cache` refuses to run against it. It does not affect the Web UI's Explore, Files, or People/domains workspaces, which require the SQLite + DuckDB/Parquet cache regardless of this setting and are unavailable on PostgreSQL; see [PostgreSQL Backend](/docs/architecture/postgresql/) for the current scope.

### `[backup]`

Default settings for `msgvault backup`. See [Backup](/docs/usage/backup/) for the
capture, verify, and restore workflow.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `repo` | — | Default backup repository directory used when a backup subcommand omits `--repo` |
| `zstd_level` | `0` | Compression level for backup pack files. `0` uses msgvault's built-in default; otherwise use `1` through `19` |

### `[remote]`

When set, archive-access CLI commands use the remote server by default. Without `[remote].url`, they use the local background daemon instead. Pass `--local` to use the local daemon instead of the configured remote.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | — | Remote API base URL (e.g. `http://nas-ip:8080`) |
| `api_key` | — | API key used by remote commands |
| `allow_insecure` | `false` | Allow HTTP remote connections |

Affected CLI commands include `search` (FTS mode), `query`, `show-message`, `stats`, `list-accounts`, `list-senders`, `list-domains`, `list-labels`, `identity` subcommands, `collection` subcommands, `export-eml`, `export-attachment`, `export-attachments`, and `tui`.

### `[[accounts]]`

Scheduled sync sources for the web server. Each `[[accounts]]` entry defines a
cron schedule for automatic background syncing. Gmail, IMAP, Microsoft Teams,
and Discord sources are supported. For IMAP or Teams, use the account display
name/email when available rather than a raw provider identifier. Discord
schedules must use the exact guild ID because guild display names are mutable
and may be duplicated.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `email` | (required) | Account identifier/display name, or exact Discord guild ID, to sync |
| `schedule` | — | Cron expression for sync schedule (e.g., `0 * * * *`) |
| `enabled` | `true` | Whether scheduled sync is active for this account |

For example, schedule one previously registered Discord guild independently:

```toml
[[accounts]]
email = "123456789012345678"
schedule = "*/30 * * * *"
enabled = true
```

### SyncTech SMS Sources

Scheduled SMS Backup & Restore sources are configured with `[[synctech_sms.sources]]` entries. These are created automatically by `msgvault add-synctech-sms-drive`, but can also be edited directly.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | (required) | Source name used by `sync-synctech-sms <name>` and scheduler logs |
| `enabled` | `true` | Whether the source is active |
| `backend` | `local` | `local` for a path on disk, or `drive` for Google Drive |
| `path` | — | Local XML/ZIP file or directory when `backend = "local"` |
| `folder_id` | — | Google Drive folder ID when `backend = "drive"` |
| `google_account` | — | Google account used for Drive access |
| `owner_phone` | (required) | Owner phone number in E.164 format |
| `schedule` | — | Cron expression used by `msgvault serve` |
| `include_sms` | `true` | Import SMS records |
| `include_mms` | `true` | Import MMS records |
| `include_calls` | `true` | Import call logs |
| `include_attachments` | `true` | Import MMS attachments |
| `stable_after` | `10m` | How long Drive files must remain unchanged before import |
| `oauth_app` | — | Named Google OAuth app to use |

### Google Calendar Sources

Scheduled Google Calendar sync is configured with top-level `[[gcal]]` entries. Each entry is one OAuth account; `msgvault serve` runs it on the given cron schedule (first run full-syncs and registers calendars, later runs are incremental). Authorize the account first with `msgvault add-calendar`.

```toml
[[gcal]]
name = "primary"                 # optional; defaults to email
email = "you@gmail.com"          # OAuth account = token key
oauth_app = ""                   # optional named OAuth app
calendars = []                   # optional calendarId filter; empty = owner+writer
schedule = "0 */6 * * *"         # 5-field cron, no seconds
enabled = true
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | email | Source name used by `sync-calendar <name>` and scheduler logs |
| `email` | (required) | Google account that owns the token (the token key) |
| `oauth_app` | — | Named Google OAuth app to use |
| `calendars` | — | Specific calendar IDs to sync; empty syncs owned/writable calendars |
| `schedule` | — | Cron expression used by `msgvault serve` |
| `enabled` | `false` | Whether the source is daemon-scheduled |

### `[beeper]`

Archive chats from a locally running [Beeper Desktop](/docs/usage/beeper/). A single
block (not a list): the Beeper Desktop API is loopback-only, so there is one
instance per machine and the daemon must run beside it. Authorize first with
`msgvault add-beeper`.

```toml
[beeper]
# url = "http://localhost:23373"  # Beeper Desktop API (default)
enabled = true                    # gate for the daemon schedule
schedule = "*/30 * * * *"         # 5-field cron; empty = manual sync only
accounts = []                     # accountID include filter (empty = all)
exclude_accounts = []             # skip networks archived natively, e.g. ["whatsapp"]
rate_limit_qps = 20               # request rate against the local API
media = true                      # download attachment bytes
media_scope = "all"               # all, direct, or none
media_max_participants = 20       # skip media from larger rooms; 0 = no cap
max_media_mb = 250                # per-attachment download cap (MiB)

# [beeper.accounts_config.signal]  # per-account override, keyed by accountID
# media = true
# max_media_mb = 500
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | `http://localhost:23373` | Beeper Desktop API base URL |
| `enabled` | `false` | Whether the daemon schedules Beeper sync |
| `schedule` | — | Cron expression used by `msgvault serve` |
| `accounts` | all | Beeper accountIDs to sync (include filter) |
| `exclude_accounts` | — | Beeper accountIDs to skip (wins over `accounts`) |
| `rate_limit_qps` | `20` | Request rate limit against the local API |
| `media` | `true` | Download attachment bytes (failed downloads retry via `backfill-beeper-media`) |
| `media_scope` | `all` | `all`, `direct`, or `none`; see [Media policy](#media-policy) |
| `media_max_participants` | `20` | Skip media from conversations above this many participants; `0` = no cap |
| `max_media_mb` | `250` | Per-attachment download cap in MiB (over-cap media is recorded as a `size_cap` skip and retried only after the cap changes) |
| `accounts_config` | — | Per-accountID `media` and `max_media_mb` overrides |

#### Send Beeper audio to Docbank

The daemon can send stored Beeper WAV and MP3 audio, with Beeper's own
transcript, to a separately running Docbank media service. The service needs
Docbank's media HTTP routes. See
[Send audio to Docbank](/docs/usage/beeper/#send-audio-to-docbank) for what is
sent and how progress is tracked.

```toml
[integrations.docbank]
enabled = true
url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"     # your Docbank daemon; the port is an example
api_key_env = "DOCBANK_API_KEY"   # daemon environment variable with the key
upload_consent = true             # allow archive audio to leave msgvault
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Schedule the Beeper media job in `msgvault serve` |
| `url` | — | Docbank base URL: HTTPS, or HTTP on a loopback address. User info, query strings and fragments are rejected |
| `api_key_env` | — | Name of the daemon environment variable that holds the Docbank API key. It is read for each request and sent as `X-Api-Key` |
| `upload_consent` | `false` | Allow audio and transcripts to be sent to `url`. Without it the job only records local state |

The daemon reads these settings at startup, so restart it after a change. A new
`url` starts a separate delivery record; earlier rows stay. Disabling the route
stops the job and keeps its rows. A failed setup, such as an invalid `url`,
does the same and logs a warning. `upload_consent` covers transport only; the
Docbank daemon's own processing consent still decides whether transcripts are
processed.

### `[slack]`

Archive [Slack workspaces](/docs/usage/slack/). A single block covers every
registered workspace (tokens are per-workspace files). Authorize each
workspace first with `msgvault add-slack`.

```toml
[slack]
enabled = true                    # gate for the daemon schedule
schedule = "*/30 * * * *"         # 5-field cron; empty = manual sync only
channels = []                     # channel-name include filter (empty = all memberships)
exclude_channels = []             # channel names to skip, e.g. ["noise"]
dms = true                        # sync one-to-one direct messages
group_dms = true                  # sync group direct messages
media = true                      # download shared-file bytes
media_scope = "all"               # all, direct, or none
media_max_participants = 20       # skip files from larger channels; 0 = no cap
max_media_mb = 250                # per-file download cap (MiB)

# [slack.accounts_config.T0123456]  # per-workspace override, keyed by team ID
# media = false
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Whether the daemon schedules Slack sync |
| `schedule` | — | Cron expression used by `msgvault serve` |
| `channels` | all | Channel names to sync (include filter; never applies to DMs or group DMs) |
| `exclude_channels` | — | Channel names to skip (wins over `channels`) |
| `dms` | `true` | Sync one-to-one DMs; `false` pauses them without removing archived messages |
| `group_dms` | `true` | Sync group DMs; `false` pauses them without removing archived messages |
| `media` | `true` | Download shared-file bytes (failed downloads retry via `backfill-slack-media`) |
| `media_scope` | `all` | `all`, `direct` (DMs and group DMs only), or `none`; see [Media policy](#media-policy) |
| `media_max_participants` | `20` | Skip files from conversations above this many members; `0` = no cap |
| `max_media_mb` | `250` | Per-file download cap in MiB (over-cap files are recorded as a `size_cap` skip and retried only after the cap changes) |
| `accounts_config` | — | Per-team-ID `media` and `max_media_mb` overrides |

### `[teams]`

Media policy for [Microsoft Teams](/docs/usage/teams/) chats and channels. Teams
sync itself is scheduled through `[[accounts]]`; this table only decides which
attachments are downloaded.

```toml
[teams]
media = true
media_scope = "all"
media_max_participants = 20
max_media_mb = 250

[teams.accounts_config."user@example.com"]
media = true
max_media_mb = 500
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `media` | `true` | Download attachment and inline hosted-content bytes (failed downloads retry via `backfill-teams-media`) |
| `media_scope` | `all` | `all`, `direct` (chats only, not channels), or `none`; see [Media policy](#media-policy) |
| `media_max_participants` | `20` | Skip media from chats and channels above this many members; `0` = no cap |
| `max_media_mb` | `250` | Per-attachment download cap in MiB |
| `accounts_config` | — | Per-account overrides of `media` and `max_media_mb`, keyed by the Teams account email |

### Granola Sources

Granola meeting-notes sync is configured with top-level `[[granola]]` entries.
Each entry is one Granola account. `identifier` is a stable source label;
`account_email` is the primary identity used for organizer attribution.
`msgvault serve` runs it on the given cron schedule. Register the account
first with `msgvault add-granola`. See
[Meeting Transcripts](/docs/usage/meetings/).

```toml
[[granola]]
identifier = "work"              # stable label; defaults to "default" for a single entry
account_email = "you@example.com" # required primary account identity
api_key = "grn_..."              # from the desktop app's settings (Business plan)
schedule = "0 */6 * * *"         # 5-field cron, no seconds
enabled = true
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `identifier` | `default` (single entry) | Source name used by `sync-granola <identifier>` and scheduler logs |
| `account_email` | (required) | Normalized primary account identity used for `is_from_me` |
| `api_key` | (required) | Granola API key (`grn_…`) |
| `schedule` | — | Cron expression used by `msgvault serve` |
| `enabled` | `false` | Whether the source is daemon-scheduled |

Config loading preserves `identifier` and rejects labels without an effective
email, instructing you to add `account_email`. `msgvault add-granola` confirms
the primary identity even if aliases already exist. Manage aliases with
`msgvault identity add <identifier> <email>`, then run
`msgvault sync-granola <identifier> --full` after identity changes to repair
existing meeting attribution. A scheduled source must still be registered in
the archive; removing it prevents the scheduler from silently recreating it.

### Circleback Sources

Circleback meeting sync is configured with top-level `[[circleback]]`
entries. Authentication is browser OAuth (`msgvault add-circleback`); no
secret lives in the config file. See
[Meeting Transcripts](/docs/usage/meetings/).

```toml
[[circleback]]
identifier = "work"              # stable label/token key; defaults to "default" for one entry
account_email = "you@example.com" # required primary account identity
schedule = "30 */6 * * *"        # 5-field cron, no seconds
enabled = true
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `identifier` | `default` (single entry) | Source name used by `sync-circleback <identifier>`, the token filename, and scheduler logs |
| `account_email` | (required) | Normalized primary account identity used for `is_from_me` |
| `endpoint` | production | MCP endpoint override (testing only) |
| `schedule` | — | Cron expression used by `msgvault serve` |
| `enabled` | `false` | Whether the source is daemon-scheduled |

Config loading and alias repair follow the same rules as Granola: preserve the
label, add `account_email`, manage aliases with `msgvault identity`, and run
`msgvault sync-circleback <identifier> --full` after identity changes.
Circleback OAuth always confirms the primary identity; there is no identity
opt-out flag.

### Notion AI Meeting Notes Sources

Notion meeting sync uses one top-level `[[notion_meetings]]` entry per Notion
identity. The token must belong to a read-only integration with AI Meeting
Notes access and Read Content access. User Information access is optional; it
is required only to resolve attendee IDs to verified email addresses.

```toml
[[notion_meetings]]
identifier = "notion-personal"      # stable source label; defaults to "default" for one entry
account_email = "you@example.com"   # required primary account identity
token = "ntn_..."                   # Notion integration token; keep this file private
schedule = "15 */6 * * *"           # optional 5-field cron, no seconds
enabled = true
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `identifier` | `default` (single entry) | Source name used by commands and scheduler logs |
| `account_email` | (required) | Normalized primary identity for relationships; it is not assumed to be the meeting organizer |
| `token` | (required) | Read-only Notion integration token |
| `schedule` | — | Cron expression used by `msgvault serve` |
| `enabled` | `false` | Whether the source is daemon-scheduled |

Run `msgvault add-notion-meetings <identifier>` to validate access and register
the source before enabling a schedule. Removing the source prevents the
scheduler from recreating it. See [Meeting Transcripts](/docs/usage/meetings/) for
the 50-result discovery limit, attendee visibility, transcript retries, and
stored data.

### `[vector]`

Top-level toggle and backend marker for semantic/hybrid search. SQLite vector search requires a build with `sqlite_vec` support (default via `make build`). PostgreSQL vector search requires a build with the `pgvector` tag and a PostgreSQL `[data].database_url`. See [Vector Search](/docs/usage/vector-search/) for prerequisites, initial embedding, and the full workflow.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Turn on vector and hybrid search. When `false`, `mode=vector` and `mode=hybrid` return `vector_not_enabled`. |
| `backend` | `sqlite-vec` | Backend marker. Supported values are `sqlite-vec` and `pgvector`; the concrete backend is selected from `[data].database_url`. |
| `db_path` | `<data_dir>/vectors.db` | SQLite vector database path. Ignored by the PostgreSQL pgvector backend. |
| `skip_extension_create` | `false` | PostgreSQL only. Skip `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector` when pgvector is already installed by an administrator. |

#### `[vector.embeddings]`

External OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoint used to convert message text into vectors. msgvault does not host a model; it calls the endpoint you configure. Use a local or self-hosted endpoint (Ollama, llama.cpp `server`, LM Studio, etc.) when message text must stay on your machine or network. Hosted endpoints also work but receive the text being embedded.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `api_format` | `openai` | Request contract: `openai` (OpenAI-compatible `/embeddings`, one vector per message chunk) or `voyage-contextual` (Voyage `/contextualizedembeddings`; pins `model = "voyage-context-4"` and embeds chat conversation windows and turn-aware meeting chunks as contextual documents). |
| `endpoint` | (required) | HTTP(S) base URL for an OpenAI-compatible embeddings API. msgvault appends `/embeddings` (for example, set `http://localhost:11434/v1`, not `.../embeddings`). |
| `model` | (required) | Model name to pass in each request (e.g., `nomic-embed-text`). |
| `dimension` | (required) | Vector dimension. Must match the model's output dimension. |
| `document_prefix` | `""` | Model-specific instruction prepended to every document chunk after chunking (for example, `"search_document: "` for `nomic-embed-text`). The prefix does not reduce `max_input_chars`; maximum 4096 UTF-8 bytes. |
| `query_prefix` | `""` | Model-specific instruction prepended to every vector-search query (for example, `"search_query: "` for `nomic-embed-text`); maximum 4096 UTF-8 bytes. |
| `api_key_env` | — | Name of an environment variable containing the API key. Omit for anonymous endpoints. |
| `batch_size` | `32` | Embedding inputs per HTTP call. Long messages can contribute multiple chunk inputs. |
| `timeout` | `30s` | Per-request timeout. |
| `max_retries` | `3` | Retries per batch on transient failures. |
| `max_input_chars` | `32768` | Character cap per embedding chunk, counted in characters rather than tokens. Too high and chunks are rejected or silently truncated; too low and long messages split into more chunks, adding embedding overhead. For example, start around `6000` for a 2k-token model such as Ollama's `nomic-embed-text`, then check representative content. See [Matching `max_input_chars` to your embedder's context window](usage/vector-search.md#matching-max_input_chars-to-your-embedders-context-window). |
| `eta_window` | `10` | Number of recent progress samples used for ETA smoothing. |

##### Stored provider credentials

Instead of naming an environment variable in `api_key_env`, you can store a
provider API key through Settings in the Web UI or the TUI. Stored keys live in
`tokens/provider-credentials.json` under the data directory with owner-only
file permissions. They are never written to `config.toml`. After saving,
Settings shows only a masked hint of the key, its first three and last three
characters, and whether it comes from the store or from the environment; the
key itself is never returned.

A stored key takes precedence over the environment variable named by
`api_key_env`. Each stored key is bound to the endpoint origin (scheme, host,
and port) it was saved for. If you later change the endpoint to another origin,
the stored key is removed automatically and must be entered again, so a key
is never sent to a host it was not entered for.

Changing a stored key for vector or multimodal (visual) embeddings requires a daemon
restart, like the other `[vector]` settings. Person enrichment and sweep keys
apply on the next run.

The index generation fingerprint includes the model, dimension, document and query prefixes, preprocessing settings, `max_input_chars`, embedding policy, and scope. Changing those settings triggers a stale-index error on the next vector/hybrid query. For an existing account-scoped generation built with CLI flags, set matching `[vector.embed.scope].accounts` and restart the daemon; otherwise run `msgvault embeddings build --full-rebuild`.

#### `[vector.preprocess]`

Controls text normalization before embedding.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `strip_quotes` | `true` | Drop quoted reply blocks (`> ...` lines, reply preambles) before embedding. |
| `strip_signatures` | `true` | Drop trailing signature blocks (content after `-- `). |
| `strip_html` | `true` | Convert HTML-only bodies to text and remove HTML markup before embedding. |
| `strip_base64` | `true` | Remove base64/data blobs before HTML stripping so encoded data does not crowd out prose. |
| `strip_url_tracking` | `true` | Remove common tracking parameters such as `utm_*`, `fbclid`, and `gclid` from URLs. |
| `collapse_whitespace` | `true` | Normalize repeated horizontal whitespace and blank lines. |

#### `[vector.search]`

Hybrid ranking parameters applied at query time.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `rrf_k` | `60` | Reciprocal Rank Fusion constant. Higher values flatten score differences between signals. |
| `k_per_signal` | `100` | Candidate pool size drawn from each signal (BM25 or vector) before fusion. |
| `subject_boost` | `2.0` | Multiplier applied when a query term matches a message's subject line. |
| `max_page_size_hybrid` | `50` | Hard cap on `page_size` for vector/hybrid responses. Set to `0` to disable clamping. |
| `sqlite_accelerator` | `auto` | Use a ready SQLite approximate index. Set to `exact` to keep exhaustive vector search. PostgreSQL ignores this setting. |
| `ann_nprobe` | `8` | SQLite index partitions searched per query. Higher values trade latency for recall. |
| `ann_oversample` | `8` | Approximate candidates requested per result before exact reranking. Range: 1–128. |
| `ann_threads` | CPU count, max `128` | Native worker threads used by `msgvault embeddings optimize`. Range: 1–128. |

Accelerator tuning does not change the embedding generation fingerprint. It
changes how stored vectors are searched or optimized, not how text is sent to
the embedding provider.

#### `[vector.embed.scope]`

Optional scope for newly built embedding generations. The zero value embeds the
full archive. A scoped generation embeds only matching `messages.message_type`
values:

```toml
[vector.embed.scope]
message_types = ["teams"]
```

Scoped generations are intentionally partial. Vector and hybrid queries against
a scoped index must include a compatible `message_type` filter, such as
`msgvault search "release planning" --mode hybrid --message-type teams`; an
unscoped vector/hybrid query returns `index_scope_mismatch` instead of using the
partial index as if it covered the full archive.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `message_types` | `[]` (all types) | Embed only messages of these types. |
| `accounts` | `[]` (all accounts) | Embed only these accounts' messages, by canonical account identifier (display names are rejected here — they are not stable identities for a privacy boundary). Resolved to source IDs at startup; an unknown identifier fails vector initialization (or the CLI command). The daemon's scheduled embeds honor this scope, so it also acts as a privacy boundary: unlisted accounts' text is never sent to the embedding endpoint. |

`accounts` and `message_types` compose (both filters apply). The CLI flags
`--account`/`--collection` on `msgvault embeddings build`/`resume` override
`accounts` for a single run. Either scope dimension is part of the generation
fingerprint: changing it requires `msgvault embeddings build --full-rebuild`,
and because the fingerprint records archive-local source IDs, re-adding an
account under a new source ID also requires a rebuild. Account-scoped indexes
do not gate search the way message-type scopes do: out-of-scope accounts
simply have no vector matches and rank on BM25 alone in hybrid mode.

#### `[vector.embed.schedule]`

Optional background scheduling for the embed worker inside `msgvault serve`.
Empty config disables scheduled embedding; you can still run
`msgvault embeddings build` by hand.

| Key              | Default | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cron`           | —       | 5-field cron expression. Empty string disables the standalone cron.                                                                          |
| `run_after_sync` | `false` | Run an embed pass after successful scheduled Gmail, IMAP, Teams, and Discord syncs. Other sources use the standalone cron or a manual build. |

`msgvault setup providers` supplies `run_after_sync = true` and
`cron = "*/15 * * * *"` when it enables a text lane. It preserves either key
when explicitly set, including `false` and `""`. Already enabled text lanes keep
their schedules. See
[Recommended Configuration](usage/recommended-configuration.md).

#### `[vector.people]`

Semantic people search: one curated document per durable person, built from
searchable non-sensitive attributes, embedded into the text-search generation.
Requires `[vector] enabled = true` and a separate consent
(`msgvault person provider consent --semantic-embeddings --yes`).

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Embed curated person documents and serve `msgvault person search`. |
| `retention_posture` | — | Your assertion about the embedding provider's retention; must be explicit (not `unknown`). |
| `training_posture` | — | Your assertion about the embedding provider's training use; must be explicit. |

#### `[vector.multimodal]`

Independently consented visual attachment lane over Voyage. Every value has a
default except the probe manifest; uploads fail closed without it, and a
daemon started with `enabled = true` and no manifest refuses every vector
lane until one exists.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Turn on the visual lane. |
| `provider` | `voyage` | Only legal value. |
| `endpoint` | `https://api.voyageai.com/v1` | Pinned provider root; other origins are refused. |
| `api_key_env` | `VOYAGE_API_KEY` | Environment variable holding the key. A key alone enables nothing. |
| `model` | `voyage-multimodal-3.5` | Pinned model. |
| `dimension` | `1024` | Pinned dimension. |
| `capabilities_file` | — | Manifest written by `msgvault multimodal probe --seeds <dir> --out <file> --yes`. |
| `max_context_chars` | `4000` | Owning-message text sent with each attachment. |
| `include_images` | `true` | Embed still images (JPEG, PNG, WebP). |
| `include_animated_gifs` | `false` | Embed animated GIFs; requires `include_images` and a manifest that authorized them. |
| `include_video` | `true` | Embed direct-input MP4 video. |
| `allow_image_queries` | `true` | Allow `multimodal search --image`. |

`[vector.multimodal.scope]` accepts the same `message_types` and `accounts`
keys as `[vector.embed.scope]`; `[vector.multimodal.schedule]` accepts the
same `cron` and `run_after_sync` keys as `[vector.embed.schedule]`. Consent is
recorded per generation by `msgvault multimodal build --yes`.

### `[activity]`

Dated activity projection and per-person contact state (first and last
contact, inbound/outbound, interaction count, inferred channel). It is the
deterministic source of "when did we last talk" for every person and runs
hourly by default inside `msgvault serve`. `msgvault activity build` runs it
by hand; `--backstop` rescans the whole archive.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `schedule` | `17 * * * *` | 5-field cron used by `msgvault serve`. Empty disables the scheduled job. |
| `timezone` | `UTC` | IANA zone name for day bucketing. `Local` is rejected because the projection keys replay on the persisted zone name. |
| `max_direct_counterparts` | `25` | Largest conversation still projected as direct activity between its participants. |
| `batch_size` | `500` | Messages per projection batch. |

## Overriding the Home Directory

By default, msgvault stores everything under `~/.msgvault` (macOS/Linux) or `C:\Users\<you>\.msgvault` (Windows). To use a different location, you have two options:

**`--home` flag** (per-command):
```bash
msgvault sync --home /mnt/data/msgvault
```

**`MSGVAULT_HOME` environment variable** (persistent):
```bash
export MSGVAULT_HOME=/mnt/data/msgvault
```

Both options are equivalent: `config.toml` is loaded from the specified directory, and all data (database, tokens, attachments) is stored there. The `--home` flag takes priority over `MSGVAULT_HOME`.

The home or `[data].data_dir` directory may be a symlink to an existing
directory. Local daemon bookkeeping resolves the symlink and applies its
ownership and permission checks to the target directory.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `MSGVAULT_HOME` | Base directory for all data (default: `~/.msgvault`) |
| `MSGVAULT_REMOTE_URL` | Remote URL for `export-token` (flag > env > config) |
| `MSGVAULT_REMOTE_API_KEY` | Remote API key for `export-token` (flag > env > config) |

## File Locations

All data lives under the msgvault home directory (`~/.msgvault` on macOS/Linux, `C:\Users\<you>\.msgvault` on Windows). The directory is created automatically on first use.

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `config.toml` | Configuration file |
| `msgvault.db` | SQLite database (system of record when PostgreSQL is not configured) |
| `attachments/` | Content-addressed attachment files |
| `tokens/` | OAuth tokens per account |
| `logs/` | Structured log files (when [file logging](/docs/configuration/#log) is enabled) |
| `analytics/` | Parquet cache files for Web UI and TUI analytical views |
