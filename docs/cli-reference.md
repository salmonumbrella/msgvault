## meetings

Read archived meeting evidence through the selected daemon. Requires API schema
2.27.0 or newer. See the [meeting workflow](usage/meetings.md) for coverage and
source limits.

```bash
msgvault meetings context --id 42 --id 43 --format markdown --output context.md
msgvault meetings actions --status pending --assignee alex@example.com --json
msgvault meetings metrics --domain example.com --after 2026-01-01 --json
```

### meetings context

| Flag | Contract |
|---|---|
| `--id` | Required meeting message IDs, repeatable; at most 100 |
| `--format` | `markdown` (default) or `json` |
| `--include-transcript` | Include archived transcript evidence; off by default |
| `--max-bytes` | UTF-8 content budget, default 131072; range 4096–1048576 |
| `--output`, `-o` | Output file; omitted or `-` writes the exact packet content to stdout |

Mixed or invalid selections fail. Truncated packets identify omitted content
and meetings.

### meetings actions and meetings metrics

These commands share the following scope flags. Values within a filter group
are alternatives; different groups intersect.

| Flag | Contract |
|---|---|
| `--id` | Meeting message ID, repeatable |
| `--source-id` | Source ID, repeatable |
| `--domain` | Exact participant domain, repeatable |
| `--participant-id` | Exact participant ID, repeatable |
| `--person-id` | Durable person ID; mutually exclusive with `--participant-id` |
| `--after`, `--before` | `YYYY-MM-DD` at UTC midnight; after inclusive, before exclusive |
| `--deletion` | Source deletion state: `any` (default), `active`, or `deleted` |
| `--json` | Structured response including coverage or duration bases |

ID lists and domain lists accept at most 100 values. IDs must be positive
JavaScript-safe integers. Locally deleted records are always excluded.

`meetings actions` also accepts:

| Flag | Contract |
|---|---|
| `--status` | `pending`, `completed`, `cancelled`, or `unknown`; default all |
| `--assignee` | Exact assignee email |
| `--query` | Literal title or description substring, at most 256 characters |
| `--limit` | Action rows per page, default 50; range 1–200 |
| `--cursor` | Opaque continuation cursor from the previous page |

Actions reflect the current archived source snapshot. Keep filters unchanged
when continuing a page; refresh from page one to see newer evidence.

## Global Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--config` | Path to config file (default: `~/.msgvault/config.toml`) |
| `--home` | Home directory for all data (overrides `MSGVAULT_HOME`) |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Verbose output (implies `--log-level=debug`) |
| `--local` | Use the local daemon instead of a configured remote for archive-access commands |
| `--log-file <path>` | Override log file path (default: `<data_dir>/logs/msgvault-YYYY-MM-DD.log`) |
| `--log-level <level>` | Log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` (default: `info`) |
| `--no-log-file` | Disable file logging for this run (stderr output stays on) |
| `--log-sql` | Log every SQL query at info level (verbose, for debugging) |
| `--log-sql-slow-ms <ms>` | Slow query threshold in ms (default: 100; 0 uses built-in default) |
| `--help` | Show help |
| `--agent-url <url>` | Daemon base URL for delegated mode; must be supplied together with `--agent-token-file` |
| `--agent-token-file <path>` | Path to a file containing a restricted agent token secret; must be supplied together with `--agent-url` |
| `--agent-allow-insecure` | Allow a plain-HTTP `--agent-url`; rejected by default |

---

## HTTP-Backed CLI Behavior

Commands that access archive state keep their usual stdout/stderr output while using the same API path as remote access:

1. If `[remote].url` is configured and `--local` is not passed, the CLI talks to that remote server.
2. Otherwise, archive-access commands discover or start the local background daemon and talk to it over HTTP. With `[server].daemon_auto_start = false`, they use a daemon that is already running or starting and never start one.
3. `--local` selects the local daemon even when `[remote].url` is configured; it is not a request to open SQLite in the CLI process.
4. With both `--agent-url` and `--agent-token-file`, the CLI connects to a
   remote daemon as a restricted caller. `search`, `show-message`, `stats`,
   `mcp`, `calendar`, `draft-reply`, `draft-compose`, `draft-get`, `draft-edit`,
   `draft-delete`, and `draft-recover` are available with their required
   permissions (see [scoped archive reads](#scoped-archive-reads) and
   [managed drafts](#draft-get-draft-edit-draft-delete-and-draft-recover)). The CLI rejects owner
   configuration (`--config`, `--home`, `--local`) and never writes the token
   to logs or argv. It sends the token in the `X-Msgvault-Agent-Token` header;
   generated OpenAPI clients do not model this transport detail.

This makes local and remote msgvault behavior the same from the CLI's point of view and avoids opening a large SQLite database from foreground CLI processes.

The local daemon publishes its binary version and API schema version. By default, a newer compatible CLI restarts an older local daemon before issuing the request; configure `[server].daemon_auto_restart` as `newer`, `never`, or `always` to control that lifecycle behavior. Remote servers are not restarted by clients, so compatibility is negotiated from the API schema version exposed in the OpenAPI document.

---

## init-db

Initialize the archive schema through the configured remote server or the local
daemon. When no remote is configured, the CLI starts the local daemon if needed
and the daemon owns the database initialization work.

```bash
msgvault init-db
```

---

## schema-version

New on `main`; not available in v0.21.0.

Print the main archive schema version as one decimal integer followed by a
newline. Without flags, this reports the version expected by this binary and
runs without loading configuration, opening an archive, or creating directories.

```bash
msgvault schema-version
msgvault --home /path/to/archive-home schema-version --database
```

`--database` reads the configured local archive without migrations or daemon
startup. A missing SQLite file is an error and is not created. Remote mode is
rejected unless `--local` selects this machine's local archive. The stored
version may be greater than this binary's expected version; the probe reports
it without attempting an upgrade.

SQLite and PostgreSQL store the same value in
`archive_metadata` under key `schema_version`; the CLI probe works on either
backend. A missing marker reports `0`, meaning legacy or uninitialized.
Stored markers must be positive integers; zero, negative, or malformed markers
are errors. The marker records required main archive schema work,
not a physical integrity check, API version, analytics cache version, or
optional vector backend version. Existing best-effort index/statistics work
keeps its failure behavior.

---

## migrate

New on `main`; not available in v0.21.0.

Apply this binary's main archive schema migrations directly, without starting
or contacting a daemon. This supports migration before replacing an installed
executable. It can initialize a fresh archive and is safe to repeat.

```bash
msgvault --home /path/to/archive-home daemon stop
msgvault --home /path/to/archive-home migrate
```

This command is local-only. A configured remote server is rejected unless
`--local` explicitly selects the local archive. Stop all archive users first.
The command takes the daemon-owner lock and, for SQLite, the write-owner lock
before opening the archive. PostgreSQL users on other hosts must be stopped by
the operator.

Success prints `Schema version: <version>`. Failure or cancellation returns a
nonzero exit status. An archive newer than the binary is rejected before schema
DDL. The marker advances only after required schema initialization succeeds;
failed migrations can leave committed partial changes. Require both a successful
exit and matching expected/stored versions before swapping binaries. Follow
[the upgrade procedure](setup.md#migrate-before-replacing-the-executable) for
backup and recovery.

`migrate` leaves legacy identity configuration for its existing account-confirmation
flow. Optional vector backend and analytics cache upgrades remain owned by those
subsystems. There is no downgrade mode. Neither command accepts positional arguments.

---

## add-account

Add a Gmail account and authorize via OAuth.

```bash
msgvault add-account <email>
msgvault add-account <email> --headless
msgvault add-account <email> --oauth-app <name>
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--headless` | Show instructions for headless server setup |
| `--oauth-app` | Use a named OAuth app from `[oauth.apps.<name>]` in config |
| `--force` | Delete existing token and re-authorize |
| `--readonly` | Request Gmail read-only access instead of read + write. Refused if the account already holds write access — see [OAuth Setup](/docs/guides/oauth-setup/#read-only-access) |
| `--display-name` | Set a display name for the account |
| `--no-default-identity` | Do not auto-confirm the email address as this account's "me" identity. Saved across syncs and re-authorization; only explicit `--no-default-identity=false` clears the choice. See [saved identity choice](#saved-default-identity-choice) |

If `[oauth].service_account_key` or `[oauth.apps.<name>].service_account_key` is configured, `add-account` authorizes via Google service account domain-wide delegation instead of browser OAuth. Service-account accounts do not use `--headless`, `--force`, or `--readonly`; their scope comes from the domain-wide delegation grant in the Admin Console.

### Saved default identity choice

`add-account` (including service accounts), `add-imap`, `add-o365` (IMAP and
`--graph`), and `add-teams` save `--no-default-identity` for later syncs.
Omitting the flag when adding or re-authorizing an existing account keeps its
saved choice. Use `--no-default-identity=false` to re-enable automatic defaults.
New accounts confirm their default identity unless the flag is set.

The flag does not remove existing identities or prevent the one-time legacy
`[identity]` migration from adding configured addresses. If the saved sync
configuration cannot be read, automatic identity confirmation logs a warning
and skips the write.

Removing the last confirmed identity also saves the no-default choice for
future syncs. To restore automatic confirmation, run the source's add command
with `--no-default-identity=false`.

---

## add-imap

Add an IMAP account for syncing mail from any standard IMAP server.

```bash
msgvault add-imap --host <hostname> --username <email>
```

The command prompts interactively for your password (never accepted as a flag to avoid shell history exposure). For scripting or Docker, set `MSGVAULT_IMAP_PASSWORD` or pipe via stdin:

```bash
MSGVAULT_IMAP_PASSWORD="..." msgvault add-imap --host imap.example.com --username user@example.com
# or
echo "$PASS" | msgvault add-imap --host imap.example.com --username user@example.com
```

It tests the connection before saving credentials.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--host` | (required) | IMAP server hostname |
| `--username` | (required) | IMAP username or email address |
| `--port` | `993` | IMAP server port (993 for TLS, 143 for STARTTLS/plain) |
| `--starttls` | `false` | Use STARTTLS instead of implicit TLS |
| `--no-tls` | `false` | Disable TLS entirely (plaintext, not recommended) |
| `--no-default-identity` | `false` | Do not auto-confirm the username as this account's "me" identity. Saved across syncs and re-authorization; only explicit `--no-default-identity=false` clears the choice. See [saved identity choice](#saved-default-identity-choice) |

Credentials are stored in `tokens/imap_<hash>.json` with restricted file permissions (0600). Use app-specific passwords when your provider supports them.

---

After adding an account, sync it with `msgvault sync-full`. IMAP accounts use the same `sync` and `sync-full` commands as Gmail. See [Setup Guide](/docs/setup/#add-an-imap-account) for a walkthrough.

---

## draft-reply

Create one reply draft from an archived message to an authorized IMAP
destination, or reply within its original Gmail account. The daemon requires
the matching operator grant. Without `--from`, the reply uses the confirmed
identity the parent was addressed to, or the source's only eligible identity.
See [IMAP drafts](/docs/usage/imap/#drafts) for the full sender rules.

```bash
msgvault draft-reply <message-id> --body <text>
msgvault draft-reply <message-id> --all --account <account> --from <address> --body <text>
msgvault draft-reply <message-id> --source-id 42 --body= --json
```

Use `--all` to include the parent sender, To, and Cc recipients. Msgvault
deduplicates them in order, removes the destination account's confirmed
identities, and never copies the parent's Bcc recipients. Use `--account` or
`--source-id` to choose a destination. An offline parent requires one of those
selectors; msgvault never treats imported provenance as provider credentials.

The daemon appends the composed message to the configured literal mailbox with
the `\Draft` flag, then stores the local message and its `(mailbox, uidvalidity,
uid)` receipt. The server must advertise UIDPLUS. An accepted APPEND without a
receipt returns `accepted_unidentified`, and a lost connection returns
`remote_unknown`; inspect the mailbox before retrying either result. A request
made while that source is syncing returns `sync_active`; retry after the sync
finishes.

Configure the grant by editing the daemon host's `config.toml`, then restart
the daemon:

```toml
[[imap.drafts]]
source_id = 42
enabled = true
mailbox = "Drafts"
```

Requests, Settings, source JSON, environment variables, and client config do
not grant access or change the mailbox. The host policy applies per source. For
owner callers (API key, browser session, or keyless loopback), any owner caller
that can reach the daemon can create drafts on a granted source. A delegated
caller authenticated with a restricted agent token additionally requires that
the target source and selected sender appear in the token's frozen grant; see
[agent-token](#agent-token). A draft `From` choice is local header selection.
It does not prove provider send-as permission. Draft creation never sends mail.
A later sync reconciles the saved membership when the mailbox's UIDVALIDITY
changes. Draft creation never moves an IMAP cursor.

For Gmail, enable drafting per source in the daemon host's `config.toml` and
restart the daemon:

```toml
[[gmail.drafts]]
source_id = 42
enabled = true
```

Gmail accepts draft writes with `gmail.modify`, `mail.google.com`, or
`gmail.compose`. Creation also lists send-as entries. That read accepts
`gmail.settings.basic`, `gmail.modify`, `gmail.readonly`, or
`mail.google.com`. The daemon checks saved scope information when available;
for older tokens without it, Gmail decides whether to allow the request.
The daemon accepts `--from` when it is the primary address or an accepted
alias. Service-account sources use the scopes in their delegated assertion.

Gmail writes use one provider request. A 429 or rate-limit 403 is a rejection;
retry the command after the limit clears. A transport failure, response-read
failure, or 5xx returns `remote_unknown`. For an uncertain creation, inspect
Gmail using the reported RFC822 Message-ID before creating another draft.
Managed edits and deletes reconcile on retry as described below. The archive
stores the Gmail draft and its `DRAFT` label after a confirmed response.
`draft-reply` never sends mail.

---

## draft-compose

Create a new plain-text IMAP draft on one selected live source. Provide at least
one `--to`, `--cc`, or `--bcc` value. The flags are repeatable and keep their
envelope roles.

```bash
msgvault draft-compose --account you@example.com \
  --from you@example.com --to recipient@example.com \
  --subject 'Project update' --body 'Draft text'
msgvault draft-compose --source-id 42 --to recipient@example.com \
  --bcc private@example.com --json
```

The source selector is required. The daemon applies the same host draft policy,
confirmed identity check, delegated sender grant, UIDPLUS requirement, and
structured provider outcomes as `draft-reply`. It stores the Bcc envelope in
the draft so the mail application can use it. It never sends the message or
validates provider send-as rights.

### Draft to a person

To draft to a person rather than an address, list the person's archived
identities with [`person identities`](#person), then pass a `supported` email
address to `--to`.

```bash
msgvault person identities 7
msgvault draft-compose --account you@example.com \
  --to alice@example.com --subject 'Hi' --body 'Draft text'
```

### Beeper chat drafts

For a Beeper source, `draft-compose` leaves a text draft in the composer of an
existing chat. `--to` takes the Beeper chat ID, and `--body` the text; no other
fields apply. Enable it per source in the daemon host's `config.toml`, the same
way as Gmail, and keep Beeper Desktop running:

```toml
[[beeper.drafts]]
source_id = 42
enabled = true
```

```bash
msgvault draft-compose --source-id 42 --to '!room:beeper.local' --body 'Draft text'
```

The chat's composer must be empty. Each chat has at most one managed draft;
`draft_exists` reports the existing one. `draft-get`, `draft-edit`, and
`draft-delete` work on the returned draft ID, and `draft-delete` clears the
composer. The edit body must be nonblank. Delegated tokens need `draft.create` on the
Beeper source to create; `draft-get` accepts `draft.edit` or `draft.delete`,
`draft-edit` needs `draft.edit`, and `draft-delete` needs `draft.delete`.
Delete-only agents receive draft metadata without committed or pending text,
including in error responses. A creator's `draft_exists` result carries the
draft ID without its text. `draft-get` shows the draft as
Beeper last reported it, which can differ from the text sent because Beeper
formats it. Edit and delete read the composer first and return `draft_conflict`
when someone changed it in Beeper. Beeper has no conditional write, so text typed
between that read and the write can still be cleared. A write Beeper refuses before anything changed
returns `provider_rejected`; a new draft whose text Beeper refused is
discarded, so the chat is free for another `draft-compose`. A write with an
unknown outcome returns `remote_unknown` and keeps the draft's pending
operation; the next edit or delete settles it from what Beeper shows. An edit
that finds an earlier delete settled, or a new draft's text never delivered,
returns `draft_discarded`. When Beeper shows text msgvault cannot
attribute, the command returns `pending_operation`; clear the composer in
Beeper and retry. `not_supported` means the installed Beeper Desktop does not
report chat drafts, `chat_not_found` that Beeper has no chat with that ID,
`provider_unavailable` that Beeper Desktop or its saved token cannot be
reached, and `provider_identity_mismatch` that Beeper answered
for another chat or account.

---

## draft-forward

Create an IMAP draft that forwards an archived message and reuses its retained
attachment files. Choose exactly one destination with `--account` or
`--source-id`, and provide at least one explicit `--to`, `--cc`, or `--bcc`.
The parent message's Bcc recipients are never copied.
This command requires owner access; agent tokens cannot invoke it.

```bash
msgvault draft-forward <message-id> --account you@example.com \
  --from you@example.com --to recipient@example.com --body 'Please review'
msgvault draft-forward <message-id> --source-id 42 \
  --cc team@example.com --json
```

Every nonempty attachment must have a retained, readable file in the archive's
catalog, even when its bytes remain in the original message. Forwarding reuses
those catalog references; it does not restore skipped or missing files from raw
MIME. Empty attachment parts need no stored file.

A pending, skipped, failed, unavailable, missing, unreadable, or unsupported
occurrence stops the command before `APPEND`. It never creates a partial draft.
The IMAP source must have an enabled `[[imap.drafts]]` entry, and the selected
sender must be a confirmed identity on that source.

The draft has two inline plain-text parts: your editable note, then a
`---------- Forwarded message ----------` separator with the original headers
and text. The original attachments follow, retaining their names and
`Content-ID` values when present. Attached emails (`message/rfc822`) keep their
bytes with 8-bit encoding. An attached email that needs binary encoding, such as
one containing NUL bytes, bare line breaks, or lines longer than 998 bytes, is
refused. Unknown MIME dispositions are treated as attachments.

The draft has a new Date and Message-ID. Its subject has one `Fwd:` prefix;
existing `Fw:` and `Fwd:` prefixes are removed. The `X-Msgvault-Forward: 1`
header identifies the layout for note editing. A mail client that preserves
custom headers may include it when you send the message. msgvault only creates
the draft.

When the server supplies a numeric `APPENDLIMIT`, msgvault checks the encoded
size before uploading; otherwise the server's `APPEND` response decides. This
upload check does not limit the memory used to build the draft.

With `--json`, attachment preflight refusals emit a JSON object on stderr with
`status: "attachment_preflight_failed"` and a `problems` array. Each problem has
a `reason`, plus `filename`, `part_key`, and `detail` when available:

| Reason | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `missing_catalog_reference` | An original attachment has no matching catalog row. |
| `attachment_pending`, `attachment_skipped`, `attachment_failed`, `attachment_unavailable` | The catalog records a file that is not stored. `detail` includes its skip reason when available. |
| `unreadable_file` | Opening, reading, verifying, or closing a stored file failed. |
| `catalog_size_mismatch` | The stored file's length differs from the original MIME part. |
| `unrepresented_attachment` | A catalog row has no corresponding original attachment. |
| `attachment_reader_unavailable` | The daemon cannot access the attachment store. |
| `unrepresentable_attachment` | An attachment's metadata or bytes cannot be forwarded, or the generated draft cannot retain its catalog reference. |

## draft-get, draft-edit, draft-delete, and draft-recover

Read, edit, or delete a managed draft created by `draft-reply`,
`draft-compose`, or `draft-forward`:

```bash
msgvault draft-get <draft-id> [--json]
msgvault draft-edit <draft-id> --revision <n> --body <text> [--json]
msgvault draft-delete <draft-id> --revision <n> [--json]
msgvault draft-recover <draft-id> --revision <n> [--json]
```

The creation result supplies the opaque `draft_id` and initial revision.

- `--revision` is required for edit, delete, and recover; use the current
  positive revision.
- `--body` is required for edit; `--body=` sets an empty plain-text body.
- `--json` emits one JSON result.

`draft-edit --body` replaces the note in a draft created by `draft-forward` and
keeps the quoted text and attachments. Other drafts must be `text/plain`; any
other multipart draft returns `invalid_draft` before the provider draft changes.

`draft-get` reads retained archive content, including discarded drafts, without
connecting to a provider or requiring the source's draft mutation grant. For
IMAP drafts, edit and delete continue to require the configured `[[imap.drafts]]`
policy. For Gmail drafts, edit and delete require the configured
`[[gmail.drafts]]` policy and one of `gmail.modify`, `mail.google.com`, or
`gmail.compose`. They do not list send-as entries. Delete removes the provider
draft and retains its archived content. Gmail edit and delete inspect the
current provider message ID before making a change. A Gmail web edit advances
the local revision and returns `changed_externally`; the next mutation must name
that revision. These commands never send mail.

Retry a pending Gmail edit or delete with its current revision. The daemon
checks Gmail before writing again. If the original message is unchanged, it
clears the pending claim and runs the requested operation. If Gmail holds a
recorded replacement, the daemon finishes publishing it locally and returns
`recovered` with `revision_mismatch`; review the new revision before retrying.
Other provider edits are adopted with `changed_externally`. A pending delete
can finish locally when Gmail confirms absence, or retry deletion when the
original draft is still present. Confirmed deletions with unfinished local
cleanup retry that cleanup without another provider request. If Gmail no longer
has a draft during an edit retry, the command returns `provider_absent` and
keeps the candidate content. Use `draft-delete` to finish discarding it.

Recovery applies to IMAP drafts only. `draft-recover` refuses a Gmail draft ID
with `not_supported` for the owner and `not_permitted` for delegated tokens.
The delegated refusal does not reveal whether the draft exists. Gmail
reconciliation uses edit and delete retries.
Delegated tokens with `draft.create` can create Gmail reply drafts.
For a Gmail or IMAP draft, delegated `draft-get` accepts `draft.create`,
`draft.edit`, or `draft.delete`. `draft-edit` requires `draft.edit`, and
`draft-delete` requires `draft.delete`. Each command requires the source's exact
type and identifier and the draft's archived From sender in the grant. The
frozen sender selection applies to get, edit, and delete, including when the
owner issued the token with `--sender`. If Gmail reports an external edit,
the daemon checks the adopted draft's sender again before returning it.

A grant with only `draft.delete` receives lifecycle metadata, including the
revision, from get and delete responses. These responses omit `content`,
`raw_mime`, and `candidate_content` in JSON and human-readable output, including
pending and refused deletes. A matching `draft.create` or `draft.edit` grant
allows content reads. Delegated recovery continues to return metadata only.

A missing command permission returns
HTTP 400 `command_not_allowed`. A permitted command targeting another source or
an unknown draft ID streams `not_permitted` before revision checks, draft
policy, source locking, or any provider request. `draft-send-as` remains
owner-only.
For IMAP drafts, recovery resumes a pending operation from recorded receipts. It can publish a known replacement or finish
confirmed removal without APPEND. Delegated recovery requires
`draft.edit` for an edit or active repeat and `draft.delete` for a delete or
discarded repeat, scoped to the source in the grant. An active draft with no
pending operation requires `draft.edit`, including after a delete was aborted
before writing. Recovery output keeps the saved `pending_code`.
Refused results use `refusal_code`; pending cleanup results describe the current
provider result in `observation.code`. See
[Manage a created draft](usage/imap.md#manage-a-created-draft) for revision,
provider checks, retention, retry behavior, and recovery limits.

### Local chat drafts

Slack, Teams, and Discord conversations get drafts that live only in msgvault.
They never appear in the provider's composer and no command makes a provider
request.

```bash
msgvault draft-compose --conversation <conversation-id> --body <text> [--reply-to <message-id>] [--json]
msgvault draft-get --conversation <conversation-id> [--json]
```

The conversation's source owns the draft. `--reply-to` names an archived
message in the same conversation. `draft-get --conversation` lists that
conversation's drafts oldest first, so a lost draft ID can be found again;
`--json` returns one array. `draft-get`, `draft-edit`, and `draft-delete` take
the returned `chat-draft-` ID and report `location` as `msgvault`. A stale
revision returns `revision_mismatch` and leaves the draft unchanged.
`draft-recover` returns `not_supported`. Delegated tokens use the same
permissions as mail drafts, scoped to the conversation's source, except that
listing and retrieval need `draft.edit` or `draft.delete`. Removing the source or
conversation deletes its local drafts.

## draft-send-as

List Gmail send-as identities for an owner-invoked Gmail account:

```bash
msgvault draft-send-as <account> [--json]
```

Gmail accepts this read with `gmail.settings.basic`, `gmail.modify`,
`gmail.readonly`, or `mail.google.com`. Saved scope information is checked
when available. The command reports the address, display name, primary and
default flags, verification status, and whether the
address is a confirmed msgvault identity. Delegated agent tokens cannot run
this command. It does not require `[[gmail.drafts]]` and never changes Gmail.

---

## list-folders

List the selectable folders in one or all configured IMAP accounts, including
an approximate message count for each folder.

```bash
msgvault list-folders [account]
```

Use the folder names in repeated `--folder` or `--skip-folder` flags on
`sync-full` and `sync`. When the account argument is omitted, the command lists
folders for every configured IMAP account. See
[IMAP Folder Sync](/docs/usage/imap/) for examples and matching rules.

---

## add-o365

Add a Microsoft 365 or Outlook.com account via OAuth2 with XOAUTH2 IMAP authentication.

```bash
msgvault add-o365 <email>
```

The command opens your browser for Microsoft OAuth consent, then configures IMAP with XOAUTH2 automatically. The correct IMAP host is auto-detected: `outlook.office.com` for personal accounts (hotmail.com, outlook.com, live.com, msn.com) and `outlook.office365.com` for organizational accounts.

Requires a `[microsoft]` section with `client_id` in `config.toml`. See the [OAuth Setup guide](/docs/guides/oauth-setup/#microsoft-365-outlook-hotmail) for Azure AD app registration.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--tenant` | `common` | Azure AD tenant ID (restricts which accounts can authorize) |
| `--headless` | `false` | Sign in with a device code instead of a local browser |
| `--no-default-identity` | `false` | Do not auto-confirm the email address as this account's "me" identity. Saved across syncs and re-authorization; only explicit `--no-default-identity=false` clears the choice. See [saved identity choice](#saved-default-identity-choice) |
| `--graph` | `false` | Sync through the Microsoft Graph mail API instead of IMAP. Creates an `msmail` account. Needs the `Mail.Read` permission. `delete-staged` asks for `Mail.ReadWrite` on first use |
| `--sign-in` | | Microsoft sign-in name and browser login hint when it differs from the mailbox address. IMAP only; mutually exclusive with `--graph` |

IMAP checks Microsoft's `email` claim when present, otherwise `preferred_username`. A differing username now requires `--sign-in`, including during re-authorization; msgvault previously accepted it with a warning. The flag permits that username only when `email` is absent. Failed checks preserve existing credentials. Graph mail and Teams also consult your Microsoft profile when token identity fields differ or are absent, accepting your mailbox or an SMTP alias listed there.

After adding the account, sync it with `msgvault sync-full`. For a `--graph`
account, use `msgvault sync`. See
[Microsoft Graph mail sync](/docs/guides/oauth-setup/#microsoft-graph-mail-sync).

---

## add-teams

Authorize a Microsoft Teams account through delegated Microsoft Graph OAuth and
register a `teams` source.

```bash
msgvault add-teams <email>
msgvault add-teams <email> --tenant <tenant-id>
```

This stores a Teams Graph token under `tokens/teams_<email>.json`, separate from
the Microsoft IMAP token used by `add-o365`. Requires `[microsoft].client_id` in
`config.toml` and the Graph permissions documented in
[Microsoft Teams](/docs/usage/teams/).

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--tenant` | `common` | Azure AD tenant ID to use for authorization |
| `--headless` | `false` | Sign in with a device code instead of a local browser |
| `--no-default-identity` | `false` | Do not auto-confirm the email address as this source's "me" identity. Saved across syncs and re-authorization; only explicit `--no-default-identity=false` clears the choice. See [saved identity choice](#saved-default-identity-choice) |

After adding the account, sync it with `msgvault sync-teams`.

---

## add-discord

Validate a Discord bot token and register one or more guilds as `discord`
sources. The token is read from a masked prompt or piped stdin; there is no
token flag.

```bash
msgvault add-discord
msgvault add-discord --guild 123456789012345678
msgvault add-discord --oauth-app archive-bot \
  --guild 123456789012345678 --guild 234567890123456789
```

If the bot can access exactly one guild, it is selected automatically and
echoed for confirmation. Otherwise, repeat `--guild` to select exact guild
IDs. One guild becomes one source. Setup also reports likely Message Content
Intent, channel-history, and private-thread access issues.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--guild` | sole accessible guild | Guild ID to register (repeatable/comma-separated) |
| `--oauth-app` | sole/default bot | Discord token binding label; no `[oauth.apps]` entry is required |

After registering a guild, sync it with `msgvault sync-discord`. See
[Discord](/docs/usage/discord/) for least-privilege bot setup and multi-bot binding
rules.

---

## sync-full

Download all messages from a Gmail or IMAP account. The optional account can
be an identifier or display name. When it is omitted, the command syncs all
configured syncable accounts.

```bash
msgvault sync-full [account] [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--limit N` | Maximum messages to download |
| `--after YYYY-MM-DD` | Only messages after this date |
| `--before YYYY-MM-DD` | Only messages before this date |
| `--query` | Gmail search query filter |
| `--noresume` | Ignore checkpoints, start fresh |
| `--folder NAME` | Scan this IMAP folder (repeatable) |
| `--skip-folder NAME` | Skip this IMAP folder (repeatable) |
| `--source-id ID` | Sync exactly one source by numeric ID; mutually exclusive with the account argument |
| `--build-cache` | Queue a cache refresh after the sync, even inside `min_rebuild_interval` |
| `--no-build-cache` | Skip the post-sync cache refresh |
| `--verbose` | Detailed progress output |

An account token can select more than one matching source. Use `--source-id`
when Gmail and IMAP, or two other sources, share the same identifier.

The CLI sends the sync request to the configured remote server or local daemon
and streams the daemon's stdout/stderr back to the terminal. This keeps local
and remote full sync behavior aligned and avoids running a separate direct
SQLite writer beside `msgvault serve`.

`sync-full` does not infer source deletion from messages absent from its result
set. This is especially important with `--query`, `--limit`, or date filters,
where the listing is intentionally incomplete. Gmail source-deletion
reconciliation happens only during the complete mailbox recovery described
under [`sync`](#sync).

---

## sync

Sync new and changed messages. Gmail accounts use the Gmail History API; IMAP accounts perform a mailbox scan and skip messages already in the database. The optional account can be an identifier or display name. When it is omitted, the command syncs all accounts that have completed an initial full sync.

```bash
msgvault sync [account] [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--folder NAME` | Scan this IMAP folder (repeatable) |
| `--skip-folder NAME` | Skip this IMAP folder (repeatable) |
| `--source-id ID` | Sync exactly one source by numeric ID; mutually exclusive with the account argument |
| `--build-cache` | Queue a cache refresh after the sync, even inside `min_rebuild_interval` |
| `--no-build-cache` | Skip the post-sync cache refresh |

The CLI sends the incremental sync request to the configured remote server or
local daemon and streams the daemon's stdout/stderr back to the terminal. The
daemon serializes this work with other archive mutations.

The same cache flags apply to message-writing `sync-*` commands. By default,
manual syncs leave a usable stale cache in place until the minimum rebuild
interval expires. The daemon owns any refresh after the sync command returns.
The two flags are mutually exclusive.

For `sync` and `sync-full`, either cache flag requires daemon API schema 2.31.0
or newer. The CLI reports an upgrade error before starting sync against an
older daemon.

Folder filters are applied only to IMAP accounts. See
[IMAP Folder Sync](/docs/usage/imap/) for examples and matching rules.

For Gmail, normal incremental sync consumes History API deletion events and
marks those messages as deleted from the source. If Gmail says the saved history
cursor has expired, msgvault recovers with an unfiltered, unlimited snapshot of
the complete mailbox, then consumes changes made while that snapshot was in
progress. Only a successfully completed snapshot is used to mark missing
messages as source-deleted; interrupted or partial listings do not reconcile
absence.

Source deletion updates archive metadata rather than deleting local message or
raw MIME data. Search excludes source-deleted messages by default; use
`msgvault search ... --deletion-scope deleted` or `--deletion-scope any` to find
retained history. See [Source-Deleted Messages](/docs/usage/searching/#source-deleted-messages).

---

## sync-teams

Sync Microsoft Teams chats and channels for an authorized account.

```bash
msgvault sync-teams <email>
msgvault sync-teams <email> --no-channels
msgvault sync-teams <email> --limit 100
msgvault sync-teams <email> --full
```

Full versus incremental sync is detected from stored cursors and checkpoints.
`--full` ignores those cursors and re-fetches messages, upserting rows in place
so importer upgrades can repair existing data without creating duplicates.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--no-channels` | `false` | Sync chats only and skip team channels |
| `--limit` | `0` | Maximum messages per conversation (`0` = unlimited) |
| `--full` | `false` | Ignore stored cursor and re-fetch every message |

See [Microsoft Teams](/docs/usage/teams/) for setup, scheduling, search, and inline
media backfill.

---

## sync-discord

Sync one registered Discord guild, or every registered guild when the selector
is omitted.

```bash
msgvault sync-discord [guild-id-or-name]
msgvault sync-discord 123456789012345678 --after 2025-01-01
msgvault sync-discord 123456789012345678 --full
```

One-guild selection accepts an exact guild ID or an unambiguous display name.
Without a selector, sources run sequentially in stable source order. One guild
failure does not block later guilds, but the overall command returns an
aggregate error.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--full` | `false` | Ignore stored cursors and re-fetch all available history, repairing rows and historical deletions |
| `--after` | — | Exclusive lower bound in `YYYY-MM-DD` or RFC3339 form |

Normal runs re-scan the configured trailing edit window, seven days by
default. `--full --after` bounds both re-fetch and deletion repair and leaves
earlier rows untouched. See [Discord](/docs/usage/discord/) for per-channel/thread
checkpoint and deletion semantics.

---

## add-granola

Register a configured Granola account and validate its API key with a live
API call.

```bash
msgvault add-granola [identifier]
```

Reads the key from the matching `[[granola]]` entry in `config.toml`. With a
single configured entry the identifier may be omitted. Granola API keys are
created in the desktop app's settings and require a Business plan. The command
also confirms the source's effective `account_email`, even when other aliases
already exist. Meeting-source identity confirmation is mandatory.

After adding the account, sync it with `msgvault sync-granola`. If you later
change `account_email` or add/remove an alias with `msgvault identity`, run
`msgvault sync-granola <identifier> --full` to repair existing `is_from_me`
attribution.

---

## sync-granola

Sync Granola meeting notes and transcripts.

```bash
msgvault sync-granola [identifier]
msgvault sync-granola --limit 5
msgvault sync-granola --full --after 2024-01-01
```

Incremental by default: only notes updated since the last successful run are
fetched. With no identifier, every configured `[[granola]]` source is synced.
Re-fetched notes are updated in place; a note whose stored copy, metadata, and
`is_from_me` attribution are unchanged is skipped without invalidating the
search cache and is not counted as updated. `--full` rewrites every fetched
note, which repairs existing rows without creating duplicates. A partial run
with one or more failed notes is recorded and returned as an error without
advancing the successful cursor. If other notes were added or updated first,
the cache is refreshed before the error is returned. Scheduled sync refuses a
configured source that has been removed from the archive and directs you to run
`add-granola` again.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--limit` | `0` | Maximum notes per run (`0` = unlimited) |
| `--after` | — | Full-sync only notes created after this date (YYYY-MM-DD; implies `--full`) |
| `--full` | `false` | Ignore stored cursor and re-fetch every note |

See [Meeting Transcripts](/docs/usage/meetings/) for setup and what gets stored.

---

## add-notion-meetings

Validate a configured read-only Notion integration and register its meeting
source without printing meeting content.

```bash
msgvault add-notion-meetings [identifier]
```

The matching `[[notion_meetings]]` entry requires `account_email` and `token`.
With one entry, the identifier may be omitted.

---

## sync-notion-meetings

Sync Notion AI Meeting Notes from the attendee-visible recent window.

```bash
msgvault sync-notion-meetings [identifier]
msgvault sync-notion-meetings --limit 3
msgvault sync-notion-meetings --full --after 2026-01-01
msgvault sync-notion-meetings --probe
```

Notion returns at most 50 meeting notes and exposes no discovery cursor.
Every run hydrates and checksum-verifies the selected visible meetings.
`--full` also sends matching snapshots through archive upsert so cursor/archive
divergence can be repaired; `--after` filters the visible set locally. Partial
coverage is reported when Notion says more records exist. Due transcript
maintenance runs outside `--limit`.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--limit` | `0` | Maximum visible meetings hydrated and verified; due maintenance is additional |
| `--after` | — | Local visible-set lower bound in `YYYY-MM-DD` form; implies `--full` |
| `--full` | `false` | Force selected snapshots through archive upsert instead of skipping matching checksums |
| `--probe` | `false` | Validate capabilities and result shape without printing meeting content |

See [Meeting Transcripts](/docs/usage/meetings/#notion-ai-meeting-notes) for setup,
privacy, retry behavior, and stored evidence.

---

## add-twilio

Unreleased: check a configured Twilio account's access and register it as a
meeting source. Nothing about individual calls is printed.

```bash
msgvault add-twilio [identifier]
```

With one `[[twilio]]` entry, omit the identifier. See
[Twilio configuration](configuration.md#twilio-sources).

## sync-twilio

Unreleased: archive Twilio calls, their recordings and retained transcripts as
meetings. Without an identifier, sync every configured source. Run
`add-twilio` first.

```bash
msgvault sync-twilio [identifier]
msgvault sync-twilio work --limit 20
msgvault sync-twilio work --full --after 2026-01-01
msgvault sync-twilio work --probe
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--limit n` | Process at most n calls. 0 is unlimited |
| `--full` | Revisit every call Twilio still lists, not only those from the last seven days, including recordings that were skipped or unavailable |
| `--after YYYY-MM-DD` | Only recordings created on or after this UTC date; implies `--full` |
| `--probe` | Read one page of recordings and print a count; requires an identifier when several accounts are configured |
| `--build-cache` | Refresh analytics cache after sync |
| `--no-build-cache` | Skip analytics cache refresh; mutually exclusive with `--build-cache` |

When `--limit` stops before the end of the call list, the summary says the sync
paused and prints the command that continues it. See the
[meeting guide](usage/meetings.md#twilio) for retries and coverage.

## add-plaud

Authorize and register a configured Plaud cloud account using browser OAuth.

```bash
msgvault add-plaud [identifier]
```

With one configured `[[plaud]]` entry, omit the identifier. The browser callback
runs on the daemon host at `localhost:8091/callback/plaud`. A configured remote
refuses before proxying; use SSH with that port forwarded and run
`msgvault --local add-plaud <identifier>` on the daemon host. Credentials are
stored in `tokens/plaud_<identifier>.json` and bound to the exact MCP endpoint.

The live account email must equal configured `account_email` before source
registration. A source's confirmed owner cannot change under the same
identifier. Use a new identifier for another account. See
[Plaud configuration](configuration.md#plaud-sources).

## sync-plaud

Archive Plaud cloud recordings, complete transcripts, and every note tab.
Cloud Sync and upstream transcription must already be enabled. Audio is not
downloaded; no changes propagate to Plaud.

```bash
msgvault sync-plaud [identifier]
msgvault sync-plaud work --limit 20
msgvault sync-plaud work --full --after 2025-01-01
msgvault sync-plaud work --probe
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--limit n` | Hydrate at most n recordings; newest first, then rotate through least recently attempted. Failed recordings retry on their next turn. 0 is unlimited; negatives fail |
| `--full` | Force archive repair, preserving stable source and file IDs |
| `--after YYYY-MM-DD` | Filter recording dates locally; implies `--full` and retains rotation progress |
| `--probe` | Print tool names, input schemas, and first-page counts without personal content or archive writes; requires an identifier when multiple accounts are configured |
| `--build-cache` | Refresh analytics cache after sync |
| `--no-build-cache` | Skip analytics cache refresh; mutually exclusive with `--build-cache` |

Without an identifier, sync every configured Plaud entry. Every run validates
the live account owner and checks complete content for edits. Sync refuses an
unregistered source before authentication; run `add-plaud` first.

Missing pending transcripts and notes preserve previous evidence. Deleted
recordings remain archived. Failed and canceled runs save rotation progress and
refresh committed changes before returning the error. See the
[meeting guide](usage/meetings.md#plaud) for pagination and consistency limits.

## add-circleback

Authorize a configured Circleback account using browser OAuth (their MCP
server uses OAuth with dynamic client registration).

```bash
msgvault add-circleback [identifier]
```

The token is stored under `tokens/circleback_<identifier>.json`. With a
single configured `[[circleback]]` entry the identifier may be omitted. The
command always confirms the source's effective `account_email`; there is no
identity opt-out flag.

Circleback redirects OAuth to `localhost:8090`. A CLI configured for a remote
daemon refuses to proxy this command: run it on the daemon host, where the
token is stored. Over SSH, use `ssh -L 8090:localhost:8090 user@daemon-host`,
run `msgvault --local add-circleback <identifier>` in that remote shell, and
open the printed authorization URL in your local browser if necessary. On the
daemon host, `--local` selects that host's archive; on a workstation it would
target a separate local archive.

After adding the account, sync it with `msgvault sync-circleback`. Run a
`--full` sync after changing the primary email or confirmed aliases.

---

## sync-circleback

Sync Circleback meetings, notes, action items, and transcripts.

```bash
msgvault sync-circleback [identifier]
msgvault sync-circleback --limit 5
msgvault sync-circleback --full --after 2024-01-01
msgvault sync-circleback --probe
```

Incremental by default: each run enumerates meeting IDs without a date bound
so newly created backfills are discovered even when their scheduled date is
old. Unknown meetings and known meetings created within the 48-hour refresh
overlap are fetched in detail; unchanged snapshots are skipped without
invalidating the search cache. With no identifier, every configured
`[[circleback]]` source is synced. Missing or recognized-empty transcripts
enter a bounded `pending` state and retry every six hours, normally until seven
days after the scheduled meeting time (48 hours when no usable time exists).
Expired retries become `unavailable`; a later `--full` run can check them again.

Due transcript retries are maintenance work and run outside the new-meeting
limit. Provider, contract, missing-result, ingest, archive-recovery, and
cancellation failures fail the sync and preserve the prior successful cursor.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--limit` | `0` | Maximum newly searched meetings; due maintenance items are additional (`0` = unlimited) |
| `--after` | — | Full-sync only meetings after this date (YYYY-MM-DD; implies `--full`) |
| `--full` | `false` | Ignore stored cursor and re-fetch every meeting |
| `--probe` | `false` | Print the MCP tool inventory and a sample result instead of syncing |

See [Meeting Transcripts](/docs/usage/meetings/) for setup and what gets stored.

---

## add-twenty

Validate read access and register a configured Twenty call recording source.

```bash
msgvault add-twenty [identifier]
```

The daemon-host `[[twenty]]` entry requires `account_email`, `base_url`, and
`api_key`. One entry permits omitting the identifier. Registration checks
recording, calendar, and participant access before creating the source.

---

## sync-twenty

Archive summaries and diarized transcripts from Twenty call recordings.

```bash
msgvault sync-twenty [identifier]
msgvault sync-twenty work --after 2026-01-01 --limit 10
msgvault sync-twenty work --full
msgvault sync-twenty work --probe
```

Each run reads recordings updated since the last successful run, plus a
five-minute overlap; late summaries and transcripts update the existing meeting. Recordings that can't be
archived are skipped and reported instead of failing the run. With no identifier, sync visits all configured sources.
API failures fail the run while retaining previously committed meetings.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--limit` | `0` | Maximum eligible meetings processed (`0` = unlimited); stopped scans report partial coverage, and the next run without `--after` continues, including a stopped `--full` rescan |
| `--after` | — | Inclusive UTC occurrence-date lower bound (`YYYY-MM-DD`) applied after reading; leaves the sync position unchanged |
| `--full` | `false` | Rescan every recording and refresh archive projections and attribution; resumes an unfinished limited rescan instead of restarting it |
| `--probe` | `false` | Check read access without printing content or writing the archive; requires one source |
| `--build-cache` | `false` | Request a cache build after manual sync |
| `--no-build-cache` | `false` | Skip the cache build after manual sync |

See [Meeting Transcripts](/docs/usage/meetings/#twenty-call-recordings) for setup,
stored evidence, duration fallbacks, and retained source deletions.

---

## add-muesli

Check a configured local Muesli database and register it as a meeting source.

```bash
msgvault add-muesli [identifier]
```

The matching `[[muesli]]` entry requires `account_email`; `db_path` defaults
to `~/Library/Application Support/Muesli/muesli.db`. With one entry, the
identifier may be omitted. The command fails unless the file opens read-only
as a Muesli database on the recorder in remote mode, or on the daemon's host
in same-host mode. Remote mode registers the stable source with the daemon
without transferring database paths, and the next sync uploads every meeting. It rejects changes to a source's recorder
identity.

---

## sync-muesli

Archive completed meetings from a local Muesli database.

```bash
msgvault sync-muesli [identifier]
msgvault sync-muesli mac --limit 5
msgvault sync-muesli --after 2026-01-01
msgvault sync-muesli --full
```

Every run reads the whole database read-only and updates changed meetings in
place; unchanged meetings are skipped. Attendees are resolved through Apple
Contacts unless `contacts = false`; the summary reports whether Contacts was
`complete`, `partial`, `unavailable`, or `off`. Meetings still recording or processing
wait for a later run, and meetings deleted in Muesli stay archived. With no
identifier, every configured `[[muesli]]` source is synced.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--limit` | `0` | Maximum meetings processed per run (`0` = unlimited) |
| `--after` | — | Only meetings that start on or after this UTC date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `--full` | `false` | Rewrite every archived meeting, even unchanged ones, to refresh attribution |
| `--watch` | `false` | In remote mode, run an initial scan and serial rescans using enabled sources' 5-field cron schedules |
| `--build-cache` | `false` | Explicitly request an analytics cache refresh after the run, including an empty run |
| `--no-build-cache` | `false` | Skip the cache refresh request |

`--watch` requires an enabled source with a schedule and a configured remote
archive. Keep the process running. It cannot combine with `--limit`, `--after`,
`--full`, or `--build-cache`. Transport failures retry on the next scheduled
scan, including a daemon that is unreachable or rate limiting when watch
starts. An API schema mismatch or rejected credentials stop the watcher. Watch reports a failure category and a suggested next step without logging
meeting or Contacts values. Run a manual sync for detailed diagnostics. Same-host
automatic sync continues to use the daemon scheduler.

Routine imports respect the existing automatic cache-refresh policy. Unchanged
remote uploads do not request a refresh. A same-host scheduled scan always
checks the cache, so a build that `min_rebuild_interval` held back after a hook
or manual import still runs once the interval ends. Cache flags are mutually
exclusive. Remote transfers are limited to 16 MiB per request, 200 participants,
and 50 distinct identities and 50 enrichment entries per participant. Review-only
Contacts suggestions that would exceed either limit are dropped, and the meeting
still imports. Other invalid or oversized records do not prevent later valid
meetings from importing; the run still reports failure and names each skipped
meeting's Muesli row ID.

Remote scans read every meeting but upload only those that are new or changed
since the daemon acknowledged them, plus meetings with pending duplicate-card
suggestions. The record of acknowledged meetings lives in
`<data_dir>/muesli-sync` on the recorder. `--full` uploads every meeting, and
`add-muesli` clears the record.

Remote sync, watch, and the native hook are available on `main` and are not yet
released. See [Meeting Transcripts](/docs/usage/meetings/#muesli) for setup and
what gets stored.

---

## muesli-hook

Archive the completed meeting named by Muesli's executable-launcher event.

```bash
msgvault muesli-hook < completion-event.json
msgvault muesli-hook --install /path/to/launchers
```

The command accepts up to 4 KiB on stdin. It requires `schemaVersion: 1`,
`event: "meeting.completed"`, `kind: "meeting"`, a positive integer `id`, and an
RFC 3339 `completedAt`. Unknown or duplicate fields are rejected. Exactly one
`[[muesli]]` source must be configured because the event has no database identity.

`--install DIR` creates a `msgvault-muesli-hook` symlink to the path used to run
msgvault, preserving its `.exe` suffix when present. Installing from a package
manager's stable path, such as Homebrew's `bin` entry, keeps the hook working
across upgrades. Creating the symlink requires the platform's symlink
permissions. Reinstalling replaces an earlier hook symlink; it refuses to
replace any other file. Select
that executable in Muesli's completion-hook setting. The launcher uses msgvault's default configuration;
manual invocation can use the normal `--config` flag. It reads the meeting and
Contacts locally in remote mode and uses the existing authenticated transport.
Same-host hooks delegate the selected row to the local daemon. Scheduled full
rescans recover missed hooks and import later edits.

---

## archive-remote-images

Download remote `<img src>` images from existing email for offline viewing.
This is separate from the default-off `[sync].archive_remote_images` setting.

```bash
msgvault archive-remote-images --allow-tracking
msgvault archive-remote-images --allow-tracking --source-id 1 --limit 100
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--allow-tracking` | `false` | Required consent to image requests that can activate tracking pixels |
| `--source-id` | `0` | Restrict to one source; 0 includes all email sources |
| `--limit` | `0` | Maximum messages to scan; 0 scans all matching email |

Requests originate from the archive server, not the browser. Private-network
destinations are blocked, but public hosts can still track requests. The command
requires `--allow-tracking` even when automatic archiving is enabled.

Already archived images are reused. Failed downloads can be retried by running
the command again; successful downloads are preserved if other images fail.
The summary reports messages scanned, images downloaded or reused, and errors.
Any image errors produce a nonzero exit status. Original messages are unchanged.

---

## backfill-teams-media

Re-fetch Microsoft Teams inline hosted-content media for already imported
messages.

```bash
msgvault backfill-teams-media <email>
msgvault backfill-teams-media <email> --only-incomplete
```

The command scans stored Teams HTML bodies for Graph `hostedContents` URLs and
downloads those images into the attachment store. It is idempotent because
attachments are content-addressed.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--only-incomplete` | `false` | Retry only messages whose inline media is still missing |

---

## backfill-discord-media

Refresh Discord message attachment metadata and retry pending downloads for
one guild or every registered guild.

```bash
msgvault backfill-discord-media [guild-id-or-name]
msgvault backfill-discord-media 123456789012345678 --only-incomplete
```

By default, all archived Discord messages with attachments are scanned;
already-complete messages require no download work. With no selector, guilds
run sequentially using the same aggregate-failure behavior as
`sync-discord`.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--only-incomplete` | `false` | Select only messages with pending attachment rows |

Backfill re-fetches each selected source message that has pending attachments
to obtain fresh signed CDN URLs. An incomplete attachment is unrecoverable if
the source message has since been deleted. See
[Discord](/docs/usage/discord/#attachment-backfill-and-limits).

---

## add-beeper

Register the chat accounts connected to a locally running
[Beeper Desktop](/docs/usage/beeper/) as `beeper` sources, one per network.

```bash
msgvault add-beeper
msgvault add-beeper --token-file ~/beeper-token.txt
MSGVAULT_BEEPER_TOKEN="..." msgvault add-beeper
```

Requires Beeper Desktop running on the same machine and an access token
minted in Beeper Desktop (Settings → Developer). The token is stored at
`tokens/beeper.json`. Accounts filtered out by `[beeper].accounts` /
`exclude_accounts` in `config.toml` are skipped.

Networks Beeper serves natively instead of bridging — iMessage — are absent
from its accounts API, so they are found from chat data and reported as *found
via chats*. Re-run the command after connecting a network in Beeper Desktop.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--token-file` | | Read the access token from a file instead of prompting |
| `--no-default-identity` | `false` | Do not auto-confirm each account's own identity as that source's "me" identity |

After adding, sync with `msgvault sync-beeper`.

---

## add-matrix

Register a Matrix account as a native `matrix` source. The command logs in a
dedicated device named `msgvault (read-only)`. See
[Matrix](/docs/usage/matrix/).

```bash
msgvault add-matrix \
  --homeserver https://matrix.example.org \
  --user-id @archive:example.org \
  --password-file /path/to/password
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--homeserver` | required | Base URL of the Matrix homeserver |
| `--user-id` | required | Full Matrix user ID |
| `--password-file` | prompt or stdin | Read the account password from a file |
| `--login-token-file` | — | Read a single-use `m.login.token` obtained from an SSO/login flow; mutually exclusive with `--password-file` |
| `--no-default-identity` | `false` | Do not auto-confirm the Matrix user ID as this source's "me" identity |

The access token is written to an owner-only file under `tokens/`. Running it
again for a registered user renews the login in place and keeps its history.

---

## sync-matrix

Sync joined rooms for every registered Matrix account. The first run backfills
history per room through `/messages`; later runs use a persisted `/sync`
`next_batch` token. Per-account failures do not stop other accounts.

```bash
msgvault sync-matrix
msgvault sync-matrix --account @archive:example.org
msgvault sync-matrix --full
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--account` | all registered | Sync only this exact Matrix user ID |
| `--full` | `false` | Ignore stored cursors and re-fetch complete joined-room history |

Room selection and scheduled sync are controlled by `[matrix]`. Encrypted
events are kept as raw placeholders.

---

## sync-beeper

Sync chats from Beeper Desktop for every registered Beeper account (all
connected networks). The first run backfills full locally-available history and
is resumable; later runs are incremental. Per-account failures do not stop the
run: remaining accounts still sync, the analytics cache is rebuilt for the
successful ones, and the command exits non-zero listing the failures. Without
`--account`, the `[beeper]` config `accounts`/`exclude_accounts` filters
select which registered sources sync. See [Beeper](/docs/usage/beeper/).

```bash
msgvault sync-beeper
msgvault sync-beeper --account signal --account telegram
msgvault sync-beeper --full
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--account` | all registered | Beeper accountID to sync (repeatable) |
| `--limit` | `0` | Max messages per chat this run (0 = no limit; limited backfills resume next run) |
| `--full` | `false` | Ignore stored cursors and re-fetch every message (repairs rows in place) |
| `--no-media` | `false` | Skip attachment downloads for this run |

---

## backfill-beeper-media

Retry pending Beeper attachment downloads (media that failed or exceeded the
size cap during `sync-beeper`). Idempotent: attachments are content-addressed.
If the source message is gone (deleted in Beeper), its pending markers are
cleared permanently — already-downloaded attachments are kept. Transient fetch
errors keep the marker and count as still pending, so re-running retries them.

```bash
msgvault backfill-beeper-media
msgvault backfill-beeper-media --account signal
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--account` | all registered | Beeper accountID to backfill (repeatable) |

---

## add-slack

Register a [Slack workspace](/docs/usage/slack/) as a `slack` source. Requires a
user token (`xoxp-…`) from an internal Slack app you create (see the usage
guide for setup and scope choices). The token is validated with `auth.test`
and stored at `tokens/slack_<team-id>_<user-id>.json`. Public-channel-only
tokens need no search, file, or reaction permissions; sync revisits history
for thread replies when `search:read` is absent.

```bash
msgvault add-slack
msgvault add-slack --token-file ~/slack-token.txt
MSGVAULT_SLACK_TOKEN="xoxp-..." msgvault add-slack
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--token-file` | | Read the user token from a file instead of prompting |
| `--no-default-identity` | `false` | Do not auto-confirm the workspace user ID as the source's "me" identity |

After adding, sync with `msgvault sync-slack`.

---

## import-slackdump

Import a Slackdump directory or ZIP without contacting Slack. `--me` resolves
your account from `users.json` by exact Slack user ID or unique profile email.
The import preserves conversations, threads, reactions, raw JSON, identities,
and exported files. The path must be local to the daemon host; exports are not
uploaded through a configured remote. See
[Slack](/docs/usage/slack/#import-a-slackdump-export).

```bash
msgvault import-slackdump --me you@example.com /path/to/export
msgvault import-slackdump --me U0123456789 --limit 100 /path/to/export.zip
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--me` | required | Slack user ID or unique profile email in the export |
| `--limit` | `0` | Max messages imported per conversation (0 = no limit) |
| `--max-media-mb` | configured/default limit | Max exported file size in MiB (0 = configured/default limit) |
| `--no-default-identity` | `false` | Do not auto-confirm the workspace user ID as the source's "me" identity |

---

## sync-slack

Sync Slack conversations for registered workspaces. Public-channel-only tokens
can archive all public channels, including unjoined ones. Broader tokens archive
your channel memberships, group DMs, and 1:1 DMs. The first run backfills full history and is
resumable; later runs are incremental and sweep for thread replies created
since the last run (any thread age). Per-workspace failures do not stop the run: remaining workspaces
still sync and the command exits non-zero listing the failures. The `[slack]`
config `channels`/`exclude_channels` filters select which channels sync. The
`private_channels`, `dms`, and `group_dms` settings independently select whether
private channels, DMs, and group DMs sync. See
[Slack](/docs/usage/slack/).

```bash
msgvault sync-slack
msgvault sync-slack T0123456789
msgvault sync-slack --full
msgvault sync-slack --private-channels=false --dms=false --group-dms=false
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--limit` | `0` | Max messages of work per conversation this run, thread replies included; the reply sweep gets the same budget workspace-wide (0 = no limit; every phase resumes next run so standing limited schedules converge; only the maintenance rescan is skipped) |
| `--dms` | configured | Include one-to-one DMs for this run (`true` or `false`) |
| `--full` | `false` | Start (or continue) a repair session: re-fetch every message, upserting in place (catches old thread replies and edits). Interrupted or --limit-scoped repairs resume across later runs of any kind until complete |
| `--group-dms` | configured | Include group DMs for this run (`true` or `false`) |
| `--private-channels` | configured | Include private channels for this run (`true` or `false`) |
| `--no-threads` | `false` | Skip thread-reply fetching for this run (a later threaded run pays the debt automatically) |
| `--maintenance` | `false` | Repair edits/reaction changes on recent messages (ignored by default after capture) |
| `--no-media` | `false` | Skip file downloads for this run (files become pending markers; `backfill-slack-media` fetches them later) |

---

## backfill-slack-media

Retry pending Slack file downloads (files that failed or exceeded the size
cap during `sync-slack`). Idempotent: files are content-addressed and
already-downloaded ones are never re-fetched. Files hosted outside
`files.slack.com` are metadata-only link rows and are never downloaded.

```bash
msgvault backfill-slack-media
msgvault backfill-slack-media T0123456789
```

---

## add-calendar

Authorize read-only Google Calendar access for an account and register its calendars for sync. If the account already has a Gmail token, re-consent bundles Gmail + Calendar so Gmail access is not dropped — keep both checked on the consent screen. The Calendar API must be enabled on the OAuth project. By default only owned/writable calendars are registered.

```bash
msgvault add-calendar <email> [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--write` | Also request `calendar.events`, preserving existing Google scopes; source write permissions remain required |
| `--oauth-app` | Named OAuth app to use |
| `--headless` | Print token-copy instructions for a headless host instead of opening a browser |
| `--all-calendars` | Include reader/freeBusyReader (subscribed, holiday) calendars |
| `--min-access-role` | Minimum access role: `owner`, `writer`, or `reader` |
| `--calendars` | Comma-separated calendar IDs to register |

---

## sync-calendar

Sync Google Calendar events for an account. The account is resolved from a `[[gcal]]` config entry (by name or email) or used directly as an email. The first run (or `--full`) does a full sync that registers calendars; later runs are incremental via the Calendar `syncToken`. Events are stored as searchable records (`message_type = calendar_event`) and become eligible for semantic search when the embedding worker runs. Cancelled events are retained and marked cancelled, never deleted. Sync is read-only.

```bash
msgvault sync-calendar <name|email> [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--full` | Force a full sync (ignore stored sync tokens) |
| `--limit` | Max events per calendar (0 = unlimited) |
| `--after` / `--before` | Bound a full sync to a date range (`YYYY-MM-DD`); full sync only |
| `--calendar` | Restrict to specific calendar IDs |
| `--all-calendars` | Include reader/freeBusyReader calendars |
| `--min-access-role` | Minimum access role: `owner`, `writer`, or `reader` |
| `--oauth-app` | Named OAuth app to use |
| `--noresume` | Do not resume an interrupted full sync |

---

## calendar

Control live Google Calendar events through the daemon. This is unreleased
functionality. Follow [Calendar event setup](usage/calendar.md#control-events-unreleased)
for consent and source permissions.

```bash
msgvault calendar create <calendar-id> --account <name|email> --summary <title> --from <start> --to <end>
msgvault calendar update <calendar-id> <event-id> --account <name|email> [field flags]
msgvault calendar delete <calendar-id> <event-id> --account <name|email>
msgvault calendar move <calendar-id> <event-id> <destination-calendar-id> --account <name|email>
msgvault calendar respond <calendar-id> <event-id> --account <name|email> --status accepted
msgvault calendar freebusy <calendar-id> --account <name|email> --from <start> --to <end>
msgvault calendar conflicts <calendar-id> --account <name|email> --from <start> --to <end> --calendars <ids>
```

| Flag | Applies to | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `--account` | All | Required OAuth account or configured source name, separate from the target calendar |
| `--dry-run` | All | Verify live access and return the proposed writes without applying them; availability still reads Google |
| `--read-only` | All | Reject all mutations |
| `--json` | All | Print complete results and archive receipts; dry runs and availability always print JSON |
| `--send-updates` | Writes | `none` (default), `all`, or `externalOnly` |
| `--summary`, `--description`, `--location` | Create/update | Omitted update fields are preserved; explicit empty clears |
| `--from`, `--to` | Create/update/availability | RFC3339 with offset, or local `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` with `--tz` |
| `--tz` | Create/update/availability | IANA time zone; event edits require a time bound |
| `--all-day` | Create/update | Date-only `YYYY-MM-DD`; end is exclusive |
| `--attendees` | Create/update | Replace comma-separated guest list; explicit empty clears |
| `--add-attendee` | Update | Add guest emails while preserving existing guests and RSVP state; cannot combine with `--attendees` |
| `--rrule` | Create/update | Repeatable RRULE; explicit empty clears recurrence |
| `--reminder` | Create/update | Repeatable `popup:minutes` or `email:minutes` (0–40320, at most five); `default` or `none` cannot combine with overrides |
| `--scope` | Update/delete/respond | `single` (default), `all`, or `future`; future supports update/delete only |
| `--original-start` | Update/delete/respond | Original occurrence start, RFC3339 or all-day date; required for single on a series ID and future edits |
| `--destination` | Move | Required calendar ID or configured alias; standalone events only |
| `--status` | Respond | Required self RSVP: `accepted`, `declined`, or `tentative` |
| `--calendars` | Availability | Selected IDs or aliases; default is the positional calendar; at most 50 |

Commands return completed Google writes with archive message IDs. A partial
remote failure or an archive failure exits with an error after printing the
receipts. Reconcile the reported event; do not repeat a completed mutation.

---

## import-eml

Import RFC 5322 `.eml` files inside MailMate-style `.mailbox` directories.
Arbitrary loose `.eml` files are not discovered. The directory structure
provides mailbox labels. The command resumes an active checkpoint by default.

```bash
msgvault import-eml /path/to/mail --identifier user@example.com
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--identifier` | required | Source identifier for imported messages |
| `--source-type` | `eml` | Source type stored for this import |
| `--no-resume` | `false` | Start a new import rather than resume its checkpoint |
| `--checkpoint-interval` | `200` | Messages between saved checkpoints |
| `--no-attachments` | `false` | Do not write attachment files |
| `--no-default-identity` | `false` | Do not confirm the identifier as this source's identity |

See [local email import](usage/importing.md) for file discovery and repeat-import
behavior, and [remote images](usage/remote-images.md) for the separate opt-in
that can cause network requests during email imports.

---

## import-mbox

Import a local MBOX archive into msgvault.

```bash
msgvault import-mbox <identifier> <export-file>
```

The export file may be a plain mbox file (any extension) or a `.zip` containing one or more `.mbox`/`.mbx` files.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--source-type` | `mbox` | Source type recorded in database (e.g., `hey` or `google-groups`) |
| `--label` | — | Label(s) to apply to imported messages (repeatable, or comma-separated) |
| `--no-resume` | `false` | Start fresh, ignoring interrupted progress |
| `--checkpoint-interval` | `200` | Save progress every N messages |
| `--no-attachments` | `false` | Skip writing attachments to disk |
| `--no-default-identity` | `false` | Do not auto-confirm the identifier as this source's "me" identity |

For Google Groups Takeout, use `--source-type google-groups`. This preserves
Groups thread IDs and labels, and does not auto-confirm the group identifier as
"me". Import a Groups-only ZIP or an extracted group MBOX; non-message files are
skipped.

See [Importing Local Email](/docs/usage/importing/) for usage examples.

---

## import-maildir

Import a Maildir archive without changing its files:

```bash
msgvault import-maildir ~/Maildir --identifier you@example.com
```

Reads regular message files in `cur` and `new`; skips `tmp`, symlinks, and
mailbox bookkeeping files. The root mailbox receives the `INBOX` label.
Nested directories and Maildir++ folders such as `.Projects.Go` become
slash-separated labels (`Projects/Go`). Use a stable snapshot of the mailbox
so delivery and flag renames cannot race the import.

Stores raw MIME, bodies, recipients, and attachments. As with other local email
imports, attachment-write failures are logged; the original attachment bytes
remain in raw MIME, but a rerun does not retry those writes. Exact duplicate raw
messages within the same source are stored once and collect all folder and
flag labels. Rerunning the import adds missing messages and labels; it does
not remove archived messages or labels. Moving a message from `new` to `cur`
or changing its filename flags does not create another copy.

Maildir flags become `DRAFT`, `STARRED`, `PASSED`, `REPLIED`, and `TRASH`
labels. Messages without the seen (`S`) flag receive `UNREAD`. Trashed
messages are still archived.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--identifier` | — | Required account identifier |
| `--source-type` | `maildir` | Source type stored for the archive |
| `--no-resume` | `false` | Start a fresh run instead of resuming a checkpoint |
| `--checkpoint-interval` | `200` | Save progress after this many messages |
| `--no-attachments` | `false` | Skip writing attachment files |
| `--no-default-identity` | `false` | Skip confirming the identifier as the source identity |

Interrupted imports resume by rescanning the tree and skipping stored messages.
Messages larger than 128 MiB are reported as errors and left unimported.

---

## import-emlx

Import Apple Mail `.emlx` files into msgvault. Can auto-discover accounts from macOS `Accounts4.sqlite` or accept explicit arguments.

```bash
# Auto-discover accounts (reads ~/Library/Accounts/Accounts4.sqlite)
msgvault import-emlx

# Specify mail directory
msgvault import-emlx <mail-dir>

# Legacy form: explicit identifier and directory
msgvault import-emlx <identifier> <mail-dir>
```

The mail directory should be an Apple Mail mailbox tree containing `.mbox` or `.imapmbox` directories, each with a `Messages/` subdirectory of `.emlx` files. You can also point directly at a single `.mbox` directory. Labels are derived from directory names.

Apple Mail's `N.partial.emlx` files are also imported. Apple Mail keeps the
attachments of these messages outside the MIME payload, in a sibling
`Attachments/N/` directory. The importer restores cached attachments directly
inside the message's outer multipart, within the message size limit.
Attachments in nested parts, such as inside some forwarded messages, are not
restored. An attachment without a cached file stays absent; unreadable files
or directories produce a warning. Re-importing a partial message adds newly
cached attachments to the existing message without creating another copy.
When the archived message already holds every cached attachment, the rerun
skips it instead of rewriting it. If both `N.emlx` and
`N.partial.emlx` exist, the complete `N.emlx` copy wins. The command summary
reports the number of partial files read and how many attachments the run
added to the archive.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--source-type` | `apple-mail` | Source type recorded in database |
| `--account` | — | Filter to specific account(s) during auto-discover (repeatable) |
| `--accounts-db` | — | Custom path to macOS `Accounts4.sqlite` |
| `--identifier` | — | Manual identifier when auto-discover is not suitable |
| `--no-resume` | `false` | Start fresh, ignoring interrupted progress |
| `--checkpoint-interval` | `200` | Save progress every N messages |
| `--no-attachments` | `false` | Skip writing attachments to disk |
| `--no-default-identity` | `false` | Do not auto-confirm the identifier as this source's "me" identity |

See [Importing Local Email](/docs/usage/importing/) for usage examples.

---

## import-pst

Import a Microsoft Outlook PST archive into msgvault.

```bash
msgvault import-pst <identifier> <pst-file>
```

The importer preserves PST folder structure as labels, imports email messages, and skips non-email PST items such as calendar entries, contacts, tasks, and notes.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--source-type` | `pst` | Source type recorded in database |
| `--skip-folder` | — | Folder name to skip, case-insensitive; repeat for multiple folders |
| `--no-resume` | `false` | Start fresh, ignoring interrupted progress |
| `--checkpoint-interval` | `200` | Save progress every N messages |
| `--no-attachments` | `false` | Skip writing attachments to disk |

See [Importing Local Email](/docs/usage/importing/) for usage examples.

---

## import-whatsapp

Import messages from a decrypted Android `msgstore.db` or Apple
`ChatStorage.sqlite` WhatsApp database. Apple support currently imports text,
participants, and available names; native Apple attachments are not imported.

```bash
msgvault import-whatsapp <msgstore.db> --phone <your-number>
```

The `--phone` flag is required and must be in E.164 format (e.g., `+447700900000`).

| Flag | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--phone` | Yes | Your phone number in E.164 format (must start with `+`) |
| `--contacts` | No | Path to contacts `.vcf` file for name resolution |
| `--media-dir` | No | Path to decrypted Media folder for attachments |
| `--limit` | No | Limit number of messages (for testing) |
| `--after` | No | Apple only: import messages on or after this date (`YYYY-MM-DD`, local time) |
| `--before` | No | Apple only: import messages before this date (`YYYY-MM-DD`, local time) |
| `--display-name` | No | Display name for the phone owner |
| `--full` | No | Apple only: compare every message, including chats unchanged since the last import |
| `--no-default-identity` | No | Do not auto-confirm the phone number as this source's "me" identity |

Android `msgstore.db` imports fail with an error when `--after` or `--before` is set.

See [Text Messages](/docs/usage/text-messages/) for usage examples.

---

## import-imessage

Import messages from the local iMessage database on macOS. Requires Full Disk Access in System Settings.

```bash
msgvault import-imessage
```

Reads from `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` by default. This is a read-only operation.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--db-path` | `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` | Path to chat.db |
| `--before` | — | Only messages before this date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `--after` | — | Only messages after this date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `--limit` | `0` | Limit number of messages (for testing) |
| `--me` | — | Your phone/email for recipient tracking |
| `--contacts` | — | Path to contacts `.vcf` file for display-name backfill |

See [Text Messages](/docs/usage/text-messages/) for usage examples.

---

## import-imazing-csv

Import iMessage and SMS history from an iMazing Messages CSV export. Pass the
export root containing `csv/` and optional `attachments/`, or pass its `csv/`
directory directly.

```bash
msgvault import-imazing-csv ~/Downloads/messages-export \
  --me +14155550100 --timezone America/Los_Angeles
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--me` | (required) | Your phone number or email address |
| `--timezone` | local IANA zone (required on Windows) | Timezone used for dates that do not include an offset |
| `--contacts` | — | vCard file used to fill empty participant names |

The importer accepts comma, tab, and semicolon CSV files with named iMazing
headers. It is deterministic across reruns. Available referenced files are
stored up to 100 MiB each. Larger files are recorded as skipped; missing files
and ambiguous filenames remain visible as missing attachment occurrences.
These outcomes do not fail the import or prevent contact enrichment, and a
later rerun can fill missing files. Reply links are added only when
the exported reply text identifies exactly one earlier message.

CSV exports do not share stable message IDs with `chat.db`. Importing the same
history through both commands can create cross-source duplicates.

See [Text Messages](/docs/usage/text-messages/#import-imazing-csv) for the full
format and rerun behavior.

---

## import-gvoice

Import texts, calls, and voicemails from a Google Voice Takeout export.

```bash
msgvault import-gvoice <takeout-voice-dir>
```

The directory must be the "Voice" folder from a Google Takeout export, containing `Calls/` and `Phones.vcf`.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--before` | — | Only messages before this date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `--after` | — | Only messages after this date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `--limit` | `0` | Limit number of messages (for testing) |
| `--no-default-identity` | `false` | Do not auto-confirm the phone number as this source's "me" identity |

See [Google Voice imports](usage/text-messages.md#import-gvoice) for voicemail audio behavior and usage examples.

---

## import-messenger

Import Facebook Messenger conversations from a Download Your Information export.

```bash
msgvault import-messenger --me <you@facebook.messenger> <dyi-export-dir>
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--me` | (required) | Your synthetic Messenger identifier, e.g. `test.user@facebook.messenger` |
| `--format` | `auto` | Export format: `auto`, `json`, `html`, or `both` |
| `--limit` | `0` | Limit number of messages (for testing) |
| `--no-resume` | `false` | Start fresh, ignoring interrupted progress |
| `--checkpoint-interval` | `200` | Save progress every N messages |

See [Text Messages](/docs/usage/text-messages/) for usage examples.

---

## import-synctech-sms

Import SMS Backup & Restore XML or ZIP backups.

```bash
msgvault import-synctech-sms <path> --owner-phone <your-number>
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--owner-phone` | (required) | Your phone number in E.164 format |
| `--sms` | `true` | Import SMS records |
| `--mms` | `true` | Import MMS records |
| `--calls` | `true` | Import call logs |
| `--attachments` | `true` | Import MMS attachments |

See [Text Messages](/docs/usage/text-messages/) for usage examples.

---

## add-synctech-sms-drive

Configure a Google Drive source for SMS Backup & Restore backups.

```bash
msgvault add-synctech-sms-drive <name> --owner-phone <number> --folder-id <id> --google-account <email>
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--owner-phone` | (required) | Your phone number in E.164 format |
| `--folder-id` | (required) | Google Drive folder ID containing backups |
| `--google-account` | (required) | Google account used for Drive access |
| `--schedule` | `30 4 * * *` | Cron schedule used by `msgvault serve` |
| `--oauth-app` | — | Named Google OAuth app to use |

---

## sync-synctech-sms

Run one configured SMS Backup & Restore source immediately.

```bash
msgvault sync-synctech-sms <name>
```

---

## backup

Create, list, verify, and restore incremental archive snapshots in a backup
repository.

```bash
msgvault backup init --repo ~/Backups/msgvault
msgvault backup create --repo ~/Backups/msgvault
msgvault backup list --repo ~/Backups/msgvault
msgvault backup verify --repo ~/Backups/msgvault
msgvault backup restore --target ~/msgvault-restored --repo ~/Backups/msgvault
```

Every backup subcommand requires a repository: pass `--repo`, or set
`[backup].repo` in `config.toml` to omit it. `backup init` initializes the
repository directory but does not modify `config.toml`.
`backup create` is routed through the selected daemon so the daemon can freeze a
consistent SQLite snapshot while it scans pages and attachments. `backup verify`
and `backup restore` run locally against the repository because they do not
write the live archive.

### backup init

```bash
msgvault backup init --repo <dir>
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--repo <dir>` | Backup repository directory |

### backup create

```bash
msgvault backup create [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--repo <dir>` | Backup repository directory |
| `--include-config` | Include `config.toml` verbatim; may contain API keys |
| `--include-tokens` | Include OAuth token files |
| `--allow-plaintext-secrets` | Allow config/tokens in an unencrypted repository |
| `--tag <text>` | Optional label recorded on the snapshot manifest |
| `--force-unlock` | Break a stale exclusive repository lock before creating |
| `--jobs N` | Concurrent attachment capture workers; `0` uses one per CPU |

### backup list

```bash
msgvault backup list [--repo <dir>]
```

Prints snapshot ID, creation time, message count, bytes added, and tag.

### backup verify

```bash
msgvault backup verify [snapshot] [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--repo <dir>` | Backup repository directory |
| `--all` | Verify every snapshot instead of only the latest |
| `--quick` | Skip reading and hash-verifying content blobs |
| `--force-unlock` | Break a stale exclusive repository lock before verifying |
| `--jobs N` | Concurrent pack readers; `0` uses one per CPU |

### backup restore

```bash
msgvault backup restore [snapshot] --target <dir> [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--repo <dir>` | Backup repository directory |
| `--target <dir>` | Directory to restore into (required) |
| `--overwrite` | Allow restoring into a non-empty target directory |
| `--integrity-check` | Run SQLite's full integrity check after restoring (slow for large databases) |
| `--loose-attachments` | Restore attachments as individual loose files instead of installing compatible packs |
| `--force-unlock` | Break a stale exclusive repository lock before restoring |
| `--jobs N` | Concurrent pack readers; `0` uses one per CPU |

By default, restore installs compatible repository packs directly into the
restored attachment store. Every selected attachment is still read and
SHA-256 verified; entries that exceed the target store's maintenance limits,
or packs that use an incompatible representation, are restored loose instead.
The summary reports the resulting packed/loose split and any fallback reasons.
Every restore verifies database pages and content blobs by hash and compares
the restored database statistics with the snapshot manifest. Pass
`--integrity-check` to additionally run SQLite's full `PRAGMA integrity_check`
scan; it is optional because it can dominate restore time for large databases.

Use `--loose-attachments` for downgrade or recovery. Restore into a fresh
target with that flag to guarantee a fully loose result. An overwritten target
can retain uncataloged old pack files, and `unpack-attachments` processes only
cataloged packs, so overwrite cannot currently make the same guarantee.
Restoring into the live archive home of a running daemon is refused. See
[Backup](/docs/usage/backup/) for repository format, scheduling, verification, and
privacy details.

---

## pack-attachments

Move every eligible loose content-addressed attachment into sealed immutable
pack files:

```bash
msgvault pack-attachments
```

The daemon serializes packing against sync and backup operations. Reads remain
available from loose, packed, or mixed storage, and the command is safe to
rerun as new loose content arrives. Bounded packing also runs after successful
attachment-producing commands sent to the daemon. Scheduled syncs never pack
inline: when one writes new loose blobs, the daemon's `attachment-pack` job
(every 6 hours) packs them, and the daily `attachment-maintenance` job packs
and repacks. Each automatic pack pass has a 256 MiB soft raw-byte budget and
finishes its current blob before stopping for that byte limit. Scheduled packing
and daily attachment maintenance also stop after one minute, which lets queued
scheduled work run. Each scheduled pack pass verifies at most 128
existing packed blobs or 32 MiB of their raw content, allowing one oversized
blob. Its durable hash cursor resumes verification after a restart, while new
loose blobs can be packed during each pass. Manual unpacking reads the full
catalog. Cancellation preserves committed packs. A pass with committed
progress resumes behind waiting work; runtime expiry without a checkpoint
records an error and waits for the next trigger. The first pack tick after a
restart also checks for blobs left by the previous daemon.
This command processes the complete eligible backlog immediately.

With `[data].loose_attachments = true`, automatic packing is disabled and this
command refuses to run.

---

## repack-attachments

Reclaim dead bytes from sparse attachment packs:

```bash
msgvault repack-attachments
```

Repack always runs through the selected daemon so it can atomically replace
live blob mappings, retire shared readers, and remove old pack files. It is
safe to retry after interruption or a Windows file-sharing error.
It refuses to run when `[data].loose_attachments = true` because repacking
creates replacement pack files.

---

## unpack-attachments

Restore every cataloged packed attachment to a loose file and remove its pack:

```bash
msgvault daemon stop
msgvault unpack-attachments
```

Each object is SHA-256 verified as it is written. This is the downgrade and
recovery escape hatch because msgvault versions before packed attachment
support cannot read the packs. The command is local-only and refuses to run
while a daemon holds pack readers open. With `[remote]` configured, run it on
the archive host or pass `--local` there to select that host's local archive.

---

## search

Search the archive with Gmail-like query syntax. Supports keyword (FTS5), semantic, and hybrid modes.

```bash
msgvault search <query> [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-n`, `--limit N` | Maximum number of results (default: 50) |
| `--offset N` | Skip first N results (only valid for `--mode fts`) |
| `--json` | Output results as JSON |
| `--account` | Limit results to a specific account |
| `--collection` | Limit results to all member accounts of a collection |
| `--message-type` | Limit results to one or more message types, e.g. `email`, `teams`, `discord`, `calendar_event`, `sms` |
| `--deletion-scope` | Source-deletion scope: `active` (default), `deleted`, or `any`. Non-active scopes require `--mode fts`. |
| `--mode` | Search mode: `fts` (default), `vector`, or `hybrid`. `vector` and `hybrid` require vector search to be configured. |
| `--explain` | Include per-signal scores (RRF, BM25, vector) in the output. Only applies to `--mode vector` and `--mode hybrid`. |

Search and stats reject an explicitly empty collection with `empty_scope` for owners and agents.

Without an explicit message-type filter, search intentionally returns all
matching cached message types, including meeting transcripts and chats.
Ordinary aggregate views and statistics still default to email-only; use
`--message-type` (or `message_type:` in the query) when you need an explicit
search scope.

The query accepts `list:` and `list-id:` as equivalent RFC 2919 List-Id
filters. Values are case-insensitive literal substrings; quote values that
contain spaces. Repeating either alias requires every value to match.

`--mode vector` and `--mode hybrid` require at least one free-text term in the query (filter-only queries use `--mode fts`). They do not support pagination (`--offset` is rejected) or non-active deletion scopes because the vector index covers active messages only. Bump `--limit` to retrieve a larger candidate pool instead. See [Searching](/docs/usage/searching/) for the operator reference and [Vector Search](/docs/usage/vector-search/) for semantic setup.

Search tables show the subject, or the message snippet when the subject is blank.
Redirected or piped output keeps the full sender and subject/snippet on one line,
with terminal controls removed and whitespace collapsed. Terminal tables fit the
available width by shortening sender and subject text, including Unicode characters
and emoji. Fixed IDs, dates, sizes and explanation scores stay complete; very narrow
terminals may wrap. An unknown message size appears as `-`.

With `--json`, each result also includes `web_url` when the selected daemon can
provide a browser link for that message.

The daemon checks full-text index completeness in the background. The CLI
warns that results may be incomplete when the daemon finds an index gap or
is rebuilding the index. The warning also applies while a rebuild waits for
other daemon work to finish. An owner completeness check alone prints no warning. Agent searches report checking uncertainty on stderr.
API clients can still observe `index_state="checking"` while that check runs.

---

## repair-list-ids

Re-derive archived email List-Id values from stored raw MIME without
contacting a provider.

```bash
msgvault repair-list-ids [--apply]
```

The default is a dry run and does not modify the archive. Pass `--apply` to
write changed values and mark derived analytics stale for the normal rebuild path.

The analytics cache exports invalid UTF-8 List-IDs as NULL so mailing-list
filters cannot match unrelated messages through replacement characters.
Use `--apply` to recover these values when the stored raw MIME has an intact
List-Id header. This cannot recover a header that is itself damaged.

---

## repair-labels

Rebuild an IMAP source's message labels from its stored mailbox memberships,
without contacting the provider.

```bash
msgvault repair-labels [identifier] [--apply]
```

An add-only label merge — used when a sync's mailbox snapshot is incomplete or
a dedup match is not fully confirmed — never removes a label. If the
message's stored membership never changes again, nothing later revisits it,
and a stray label can persist. `repair-labels` rebuilds a message's labels
straight from `imap_message_memberships`, the same rebuild a full mailbox
enumeration performs, without a live IMAP connection.

With no identifier, every IMAP source is repaired. An identifier scopes the
repair to one matching source. The default is a dry run and does not modify
the archive. Pass `--apply` to write changed labels and mark derived
analytics stale for the normal rebuild path.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--apply` | Write repaired labels to the archive. |

---

## media search

Find spoken words in recording transcripts through the daemon's configured Docbank integration:

```bash
msgvault media search "quarterly numbers"
msgvault media search "quarterly numbers" --person 7 --direction from_person --limit 20 --json
```

`--mode lexical` is the default. Semantic and hybrid are unavailable. `--limit` accepts 1 to 100 message occurrences. `--direction` accepts `from_person`, `to_person` or `group` and requires `--person`.

The table shows message, conversation and attachment IDs, supplied or generated origin, plain excerpt, and recorded timing. An empty result proves no match only with complete coverage and `partial=false`. Its coverage line reports pending media, unavailable attribution, partial coverage and truncated results. JSON preserves the same fields. Search requires Docbank's source-selected search contract. Shared audio searches the currently selected transcript; different supplied captions can leave some messages unavailable even when no excerpt matches. A recording with more than 64 distinct current caption inputs is left out; its occurrences count in `unavailable_occurrences`, with `partial=true`. See [the API scope limits](api-server.md#media-transcript-search) for the version and source ceilings; narrow the person scope if it exceeds a ceiling. Use `msgvault show-message <message_id>` to read a result in context. Browser search-result presentation follows separately.

## documents

Manage hosted extraction and local full-text indexing for standalone document
attachments. Provider operations require a private authenticated capability
manifest and exact recorded consent; local search and removal operations do
not contact the provider.

```bash
msgvault documents probe-mistral --fixtures <private-dir> [--validate-only]
msgvault documents consent-mistral --capabilities <manifest> [--yes]
msgvault documents build --capabilities <manifest> [--limit N] [--full-rebuild] [--yes]
msgvault documents resume --capabilities <manifest> [--limit N] [--yes]
msgvault documents search <query> [flags]
msgvault documents status --capabilities <manifest> [--json]
msgvault documents retry --capabilities <manifest> --hash <sha256>
msgvault documents retire <profile-id> [--yes]
msgvault documents purge-derived --hash <sha256> [--yes]
```

`probe-mistral --validate-only` checks the complete synthetic fixture set
without credentials or network access. An authenticated probe writes the
manifest to stdout. Run consent and build commands once without `--yes` to
review their disclosure and preflight.

`documents search` accepts `--source-id`, `--message-type`, `--attachment-id`,
`--message-id`, `-n`/`--limit`, `--cursor`, and `--json`. Its cursor is opaque
and bound to a stable index revision; restart pagination after a stale-cursor
error.

In v0.21.0, build failures include available local causes alongside
the document hash and reason code. `documents status` lists up to 20 current
failed documents, including failed replacements in an active rebuild. JSON
output adds `status.failures` and `status.failures_exhausted`. Each failure has
`canonical_blob_hash`, `reason_code`, `detail`, and `state`; detail is a bounded
single line and may be empty for historical failures. Use `documents retry` and
then build again to obtain fresh diagnostics for an older failure.

To include inline documents, set
`[attachments.documents.scope].include_inline = true` and record exact consent
again. The default is false. See the
[scope configuration](configuration.md#attachmentsdocuments) for the contract.

See [Document Attachment Indexing](/docs/usage/document-indexing/) for fixture
generation, configuration, privacy boundaries, scheduling, and recovery.

---

## tui

Launch the interactive terminal interface.

```bash
msgvault tui [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--local` | Use the local daemon instead of the configured remote server |

Analytics engine and cache behavior are daemon-managed. Configure `[analytics].engine` and `[analytics].auto_build_cache` in `config.toml` to force live SQL, require DuckDB, or disable automatic cache builds. See [Configuration: analytics](/docs/configuration/#analytics).

Deprecated in 0.17.0: the older TUI-only `--force-sql`, `--no-cache-build`, and `--no-sqlite-scanner` flags are hidden and no longer control the foreground CLI. Use `[analytics].engine = "sql"` for live SQL, `[analytics].auto_build_cache = false` to skip daemon cache builds, or `msgvault build-cache` to prebuild cache files on the daemon host.

---

## export-messages

Export a bounded, provider-neutral message window as deterministic JSON Lines.
The command reads the archive through the configured daemon and never contacts
a provider.

```bash
msgvault export-messages \
  --start <RFC3339> \
  --end <RFC3339> \
  [--message-type <type>] \
  [--source <type:identifier>] \
  [--person-id <id>] \
  [--format jsonl]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--start` | required | Inclusive RFC3339 lower bound |
| `--end` | required | Exclusive RFC3339 upper bound |
| `--message-type` | all | Exact message type to include; repeatable |
| `--source` | all | Exact typed source selector; repeatable |
| `--person-id` | all | Durable person whose bound participants scope the export |
| `--format` | `jsonl` | Output format; v1 accepts only `jsonl` |

Use `--person-id N` to export messages involving a durable person's bound
participants. Linked participants outside those bindings contribute no
messages. Exported authors use the sender's curated person name when present,
keeping the address unchanged.

The stream schema is `msgvault-message-export/1`. Records appear as one
manifest, all sources, all conversations, all messages, and one completion
record with counts. A missing completion record means the stream is partial
and must be rejected. Stdout contains JSONL only; diagnostics use stderr.

See [Exporting Data](/docs/usage/exporting/) for the full record, identity, ordering,
and validation contract.

---

## export-discord

Export a bounded interval from one Discord guild using the older
`msgvault-discord-export/1` JSON envelope.

```bash
msgvault export-discord <guild-id-or-name> \
  --start 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z \
  --end 2026-02-01T00:00:00Z
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--start <RFC3339>` | Inclusive lower bound (required) |
| `--end <RFC3339>` | Exclusive upper bound (required) |
| `--format json` | Output format; `json` is the only supported value |

This compatibility command reads only the archive and does not contact
Discord. New integrations should use [`export-messages`](#export-messages),
which emits the provider-neutral `msgvault-message-export/1` JSONL schema. See
the [Discord export guide](usage/discord.md#export-a-bounded-history-window).

---

## export-eml

Export a message as a `.eml` file. Accepts an internal message ID or a provider
message ID. A numeric reference selects a live internal ID first, then falls
back to a provider ID if that internal ID does not exist. This also applies
with `--thread`.

A provider ID that matches more than one account returns an error. Use the numeric archive message ID to select one message.

```bash
msgvault export-eml <id> [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-o`, `--output <path>` | Output file (default: `<source_message_id>.eml`, use `-` for stdout). With `--thread`, the output directory (default: current directory) |
| `--thread` | Write visible archived messages in the conversation that have stored MIME as `<n>-<source_message_id>.eml`, numbered oldest first. Reports skipped messages and when the account last synced. Needs a daemon with API schema 2.33.0 or newer |
| `--account <email>` | With `--thread`, the account that holds a provider message ID found in more than one account |

Thread export captures its message list once. Messages added afterward belong
to the next export. It reports and skips messages that disappear or lose their
stored MIME before they are read; other read or write errors stop the command.
Hidden duplicate copies are excluded. The last-sync time describes account
freshness, not conversation completeness.

---

## export-attachment

Export an attachment by its SHA-256 content hash.

```bash
msgvault export-attachment <content-hash> [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-o`, `--output <path>` | Output file path (use `-` for stdout) |
| `--base64` | Output raw base64 to stdout |
| `--json` | Output as JSON with base64-encoded data |

The `--json`, `--base64`, and `--output` flags are mutually exclusive.

Stdout output, including `--json`, streams before download verification finishes. Consume it only after the command exits successfully. Use `--output <path>` to save a verified file.

See [Exporting Data](/docs/usage/exporting/) for usage examples.

---

## export-attachments

Export all attachments from a message as individual files.

```bash
msgvault export-attachments <message-id> [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-o`, `--output <dir>` | Output directory (default: current directory) |

Accepts internal numeric IDs or Gmail message IDs. See [Exporting Data](/docs/usage/exporting/) for usage examples.

---

## create-subset

Create a new SQLite archive containing the requested number of most recent
messages and the records they reference. The destination receives its own
`msgvault.db` and can be opened as a separate msgvault home.

```bash
msgvault create-subset --output ./subset-vault --rows 1000
MSGVAULT_HOME=./subset-vault msgvault tui
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-o`, `--output <directory>` | Destination directory (required) |
| `--rows <count>` | Number of most recent messages to copy; must be positive (required) |
| `--include-identity` | Copy complete identity clusters for included participants and every confirmed address of each included account |
| `--include-attributes` | Copy current and historical person and organization attribute values |
| `--include-profiles` | Copy profiles, profile history and media, relationships, employment history, and referenced organizations |
| `--include-vcard-resources` | Copy complete native vCards and retired UID aliases; requires `--include-profiles` |

The command is SQLite-only. Without `--include-identity`, it copies only the
confirmed addresses each account's included messages use, including addresses
in the stored headers of mail not yet attributed, so each message keeps its
account. The optional identity, attribute, profile, and vCard flags can copy
personal records that have no message in the subset; read the command's
warning before sharing its output.

---

## export-token

Export a browser-created OAuth refresh token to a remote msgvault instance.

Use this for headless deployments (NAS, cloud VM, any remote server) that cannot run a browser flow.

```bash
msgvault export-token <email> [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--to <url>` | Remote msgvault URL (or `MSGVAULT_REMOTE_URL`) |
| `--api-key <key>` | API key (or `MSGVAULT_REMOTE_API_KEY`) |
| `--allow-insecure` | Allow HTTP for trusted networks (for example Tailscale) |

`export-token` uploads `~/.msgvault/tokens/<email>.json` to `/api/v1/auth/token/<email>`, saves it in the remote token store, and posts account metadata to `/api/v1/accounts`.

---

## verify

Verify archive integrity against Gmail through the configured remote server or
local daemon. The command streams the daemon's stdout/stderr back to the
terminal.

```bash
msgvault verify <email> [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--sample N` | Messages to sample (default: 100) |
| `--skip-db-check` | Skip SQLite integrity check |
| `--json` | Emit machine-readable JSON summary |

---

## stats

Show archive statistics.

```bash
msgvault stats [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--account` | Show stats for a specific account |
| `--collection` | Show stats for all member accounts of a collection |

---

## People command guide

Use the [people guide](/docs/usage/people/) for the workflow. Observed contacts
use participant IDs; saved profiles use person IDs. Each command below takes
the ID named in its arguments.

### identity matches

Review archive-derived identity suggestions with a token from the current
review snapshot:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `identity matches list [--state candidate] [--limit 100] [--offset 0] [--json]` | List candidate, accepted, rejected, conflict, or all match records |
| `identity matches show <id> [--json]` | Inspect evidence, blockers, and the current review token |
| `identity matches accept <id> --review-token <token> [--notes-file <path> | --notes-stdin] [--json]` | Accept the reviewed suggestion and apply its participant link |
| `identity matches reject <id> --review-token <token> [--notes-file <path> | --notes-stdin] [--json]` | Reject the reviewed suggestion while retaining its record |

Always inspect the match before deciding. Evidence or endpoint changes make a
review token stale; fetch the match again and decide with its new token. A
successful acceptance records the decision and applies the link. Review notes
are private data. See [people and profiles](/docs/usage/people/#review-identity-matches)
for how to review candidates safely.

### person scoring

Run a bounded scoring batch to create identity review suggestions and journal
the results. Scoring never accepts matches. Configure the disabled-by-default
[`people.identity_scoring`](configuration.md#people-identity-scoring) settings,
inspect the provider disclosure and data fields, then consent to its fingerprint:

```bash
msgvault person scoring status
msgvault person scoring consent <disclosure-fingerprint>
msgvault person scoring run --limit 20
msgvault person scoring history --limit 20
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `person scoring status [--json]` | Show readiness, credential availability, consent, blockers, and the provider disclosure |
| `person scoring consent <disclosure-fingerprint> [--json]` | Consent to the exact current disclosure |
| `person scoring revoke <disclosure-fingerprint> [--json]` | Withdraw that disclosure's consent without changing configuration |
| `person scoring run [--limit <n>] [--json]` | Score and journal one batch; local blockers prevent provider requests for those pairs |
| `person scoring history [--candidate-id <id>] [--limit <n>] [--before-id <id>] [--json]` | Read redacted judgments, optionally for one candidate or below a history cursor |

`run --limit` defaults to the configured batch size and cannot exceed it.
History defaults to 100 rows and accepts limits from 1 through 100. Candidate
and cursor IDs must be nonnegative; zero means no filter. Use the returned
`next_before_id` with `--before-id` for older history.

Each run result includes its candidate's review token, proposed action, and
blockers. If a batch stops early, completed results remain in the response and
history, and the command reports the batch error. Inspect the candidate's
current evidence before accepting a proposal. See the
[people guide](usage/people.md#optional-identity-scoring) for the consent and
provider boundaries.

### person notes

Read, replace, or append private Notes while retaining earlier values:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `person notes get <person-id>` | Read the current Notes text |
| `person notes set <person-id> --text <text>` | Replace Notes |
| `person notes append <person-id> --text <text>` | Append a fragment atomically on a new line |

`--text` accepts inline text, `@path`, or `-` for standard input. All commands
accept `--json`. `set --expected-value-id <id>` rejects concurrent changes.
See [private notes](/docs/usage/people/#keep-private-notes) for
how Notes interact with search, MCP, and CardDAV.

### person search and files

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `person search <free-text> [--limit 20] [--json]` | Search curated profiles semantically; requires person embeddings and consent |
| `person files <person-id> [flags]` | Find archived attachments related to the person's linked identities |

Person search accepts `--limit` from 1–100. File lookup defaults to the
`metadata` lane and 100 results. Its main filters are `--direction`,
`--filename`, `--mime-family`, `--after`, and `--before`.
`--lane documents`, `visual`, or `all` requires `--query`; a `--cursor` belongs
to one lane and cannot be used with `all`. See
[person search](/docs/usage/people/#find-a-person-by-what-you-remember) and
[person files](/docs/usage/people/#find-files-related-to-a-person) for index
requirements, supported filters, and pagination.

### person track, provider, sweep, and facts

Tracking chooses which profiles automatic maintenance may process. It does not
grant consent to a provider or enroll a person in briefs.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `person track <person-id>` / `person untrack <person-id>` | Enable or stop future profile maintenance for a person |
| `person provider add <name> [flags]` | Configure and synthetically check a named model provider |
| `person provider list` | List configured model profiles |
| `person provider use <name>` | Select a checked profile and enable sweeps |
| `person provider check [name]` | Run fixed synthetic input without granting consent |
| `person provider consent [name] --yes` | Grant consent to the exact checked policy |
| `person provider revoke [name]` | Revoke that policy's consent; `--all` revokes all stored sweep policies |
| `person provider remove <name>` | Remove a configured profile and its stored key. For a profile no longer in the config, delete its leftover stored key and revoke consent for the policies that used it |
| `person provider history [name] [--person <id>]` | Inspect redacted runs and attempts |
| `person sweep run [--person <id>] [--limit 25]` | Run a bounded maintenance pass for tracked people |
| `person sweep status` | Read redacted progress and usage |
| `person sweep history [--person <id>] [--limit 20]` | Read recent maintenance attempts |
| `person facts catalog [--include-sensitive]` | List eligible fields, their keys, and revisions |
| `person facts evidence <person-id>` | Inspect saved supporting evidence |
| `person facts evidence-status <person-id>` | Inspect changes to evidence support |
| `person facts claims <person-id>` | Inspect proposed values |
| `person facts decisions <person-id>` | Inspect resolver decisions |
| `person facts pins <person-id>` | List fields protected from automatic replacement |
| `person facts pin <person-id> <kind> <key>` | Protect a field's current or empty value |
| `person facts unpin <person-id> <kind> <key>` | Allow automatic resolution for the field again |

These commands accept `--json`. Use catalog keys, not slugs, for fact pins.
Evidence, claims, and decisions accept an exact `--target`; fact-history
commands accept `--limit` (1–200) and `--offset`. `sweep run --backstop`
revisits older evidence in a bounded pass.

Provider configuration edits run on the daemon host. Restart the daemon after
changing its active provider or policy. Profile removal uses the running daemon
to revoke consent and clear checks for both the saved and running policies. If
the daemon is incompatible, stop it before removing a profile. With no daemon,
removal updates the local archive directly.

For setup, privacy controls, budgets, and recovery, see
[profile automation](/docs/usage/people-automation/).
[Provider status](#person-provider-status), [reverify](#person-provider-reverify),
[set](#person-provider-set), and [briefs](#person-brief) have additional details
below.

### person enrichment

Look up public person information through independently configured and
consented Exa or Sixtyfour policies:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `person enrichment profiles` | List saved policy fingerprints |
| `person enrichment status [--limit 20]` | Inspect policies, consent, and bounded suppression history |
| `person enrichment consent <fingerprint>` | Grant consent for that exact enrichment policy |
| `person enrichment revoke [fingerprint]` | Revoke an exact policy; `--all` revokes all enrichment policies |
| `person enrichment run --person <id> --provider <name> --idempotency-key <key>` | Request a lookup for one person |
| `person enrichment suppress --person <id> --reason <reason>` | Record an opt-out for the person's current identifiers |
| `person enrichment suppress --provider <name> --identifier-class <class> --reason <reason> < identifier.txt` | Suppress an identifier read from standard input |

Status, profiles, consent, revoke, and run accept `--json`. Suppression reasons
are `opt_out` and `data_subject_request`. The suppression forms are mutually
exclusive: `--person` does not accept `--provider` or `--identifier-class`.

For the identifier form, `<class>` is `email`, `phone`, `public_profile_url`,
`provider_person_id`, or `name_company`. Supply one non-empty line on standard
input, except for `name_company`, which requires two: the name, then the company.
Do not put identifier values in command arguments.

See [external enrichment](/docs/usage/people-enrichment/) for required identity
details, configuration, request limits, and the persistent suppression key.

## organization and employment

Keep organization details and current or historical jobs in structured records.
`org` is an alias for `organization`.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `organization list [--query <text>] [--include-retired]` | Find organizations |
| `organization create <name> [--domain <domain>]` | Create an organization |
| `organization show <id> [--history]` | Read an organization and its profile data |
| `organization set <id> --name <name> [flags]` | Replace mutable organization fields |
| `organization retire <id>` / `organization unretire <id>` | Change active status while keeping the record |
| `organization merge <survivor-id> <losing-id>` | Consolidate duplicate organizations |
| `organization delete <id>` | Permanently delete an organization |
| `organization attribute list <id>` | Read attributes; `--include-superseded` adds history |
| `organization attribute set <id> --definition <slug> --text <value>` | Set a text attribute |
| `organization attribute clear <id> <slug>` | Close an attribute value while retaining history |
| `employment add --person <id> --organization <id> [flags]` | Connect a person to an organization |
| `employment list --person <id>` | List a person's jobs; `--organization <id>` lists an organization's jobs |
| `employment show <id>` / `employment set <id> [flags]` | Inspect or edit one job |
| `employment end <id> [--end <date>]` | End a job while keeping its history |
| `employment set-primary <id>` | Select the primary current job |
| `employment delete <id>` | Permanently delete a job |

These commands accept `--json`. Employment creation accepts `--title`, `--role`,
`--department`, `--location`, `--description`, `--start`, `--end`, and `--primary`.
Dates can be partial (`YYYY`, `YYYY-MM`, or `YYYY-MM-DD`). Attribute writes
support `--dry-run` and `--expected-value-id` for validation and concurrent-edit
checks. See [employment and relationships](/docs/usage/people/#record-employment-and-relationships).

## relationship-type and person relationship

Record typed relationships between two saved profiles:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `relationship-type list` | Read forward and reverse labels for available types |
| `relationship-type create <slug> <forward-label> <reverse-label>` | Create a user-owned type; `--symmetric` requires identical labels |
| `relationship-type update <type-id> [flags]` | Change labels and presentation |
| `relationship-type delete <type-id>` | Delete an eligible user-owned type |
| `person relationship add <source-person-id> <type-slug> <target-person-id>` | Add a relationship; accepts `--from`, `--until`, and `--notes` |
| `person relationship list <person-id> [--include-ended]` | Read relationships from that person's perspective |
| `person relationship end <relationship-id> <until-date>` | End a relationship while keeping history |
| `person relationship delete <relationship-id>` | Permanently delete a relationship |
| `person relationship reviews [--status <status>]` | Inspect relationship review candidates |

All accept `--json`. The forward label means “source is the ___ of target.”
See [relationships](/docs/usage/people/#record-employment-and-relationships)
for direction and date examples.

## add-carddav, sync-carddav, and carddav

Connect CardDAV accounts, choose their address-book roles, and resolve sync
conflicts. Publishing or resolving a conflict can change the external address
book; see the [CardDAV guide](/docs/usage/people-carddav/).

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `add-carddav <base-url> <username> [--connection <name>] [--schedule <cron>] [--disabled]` | Discover and save an account; password is prompted or read from piped stdin |
| `add-carddav --google <email> [--connection <name>] [--oauth-app <name>] [--schedule <cron>] [--disabled]` | Connect Google Contacts using an authorized account token |
| `add-carddav --microsoft <email> [--headless] [--connection <name>] [--schedule <cron>] [--disabled]` | Sign in to Microsoft and connect Microsoft 365 or Outlook.com contacts through Microsoft Graph |
| `carddav authorize-google <email> [--oauth-app <name>] [--no-browser]` | Authorize Google Contacts in the browser, preserving existing Google permissions |
| `carddav authorize-microsoft <email> [--headless]` | Sign in to Microsoft for contacts without saving a connection |
| `sync-carddav [--connection <name>] [--full]` | Synchronize all enabled connections, or the selected connection; `--full` reconciles complete books |
| `carddav connections` | List connection names, enablement, runtime availability and orphaned accounts |
| `person publish <person-id>` / `person unpublish <person-id>` | Publish a saved profile or remove its remote card |
| `person publish <person-id> --preview` | Print the exact vCard and approval token as JSON without publishing |
| `person publish <person-id> --approve <token>` | Approve reviewed changes; conflict previews also need explicit `keep_local` resolution |
| `carddav books [--connection <name>]` | List discovered books, owning connection names and roles |
| `carddav books set-role <book-id> [--write-target] [--subscribed] [--lookup-source]` | Replace all three roles; omitted flags become false |
| `carddav conflicts list` | List unresolved conflicts |
| `carddav conflicts show <conflict-id>` | Compare bounded base, local, and remote summaries |
| `carddav conflicts resolve <conflict-id> <keep_local\|keep_remote>` | Choose the local or remote side explicitly |

Unqualified `add-carddav` saves `default`. Explicit sync selects one saved
connection, including a disabled connection for manual repair. Unqualified sync
with no enabled connection fails as unavailable. Aggregate sync prints counts
and safe failure codes per connection, and exits nonzero for partial or failed
outcomes. Book IDs, publication commands and conflict commands remain global;
network operations use the owning connection's credentials.

Directory and integrations can also use the
[publication API](/docs/usage/people-carddav/#sync-and-publish-selected-people).
CardDAV commands do not expose a general `--json` flag; role changes,
publication previews, and conflict list/show commands already print JSON.

---

## identity

Manage the confirmed "me" identifiers for each account.

The identity subcommands use the configured remote server or local daemon by default. `--local` uses the local daemon even when a remote is configured.

```bash
msgvault identity list [--account <account> | --collection <name> | --source-id <id>]
msgvault identity show [<account>] [--source-id <id>]
msgvault identity add [<account>] <identifier> [--source-id <id>]
msgvault identity remove [<account>] <identifier> [--source-id <id>]
msgvault identity discover [<account>] [--source-id <id>] [--apply]
msgvault identity import [<account>] [--source-id <id>] (--file <path> | --stdin)
```

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `identity list` | List confirmed identifiers across accounts |
| `identity show <account>` | Show one account's identity in detail |
| `identity add <account> <identifier>` | Add a confirmed identifier |
| `identity remove <account> <identifier>` | Remove a confirmed identifier |
| `identity discover <account>` | Preview archived source evidence; `--apply` confirms strong candidates |
| `identity import <account>` | Preview or apply source-scoped identifiers from text or JSON |

| Flag | Applies to | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--account` | `list` | Restrict to a single account |
| `--collection` | `list` | Restrict to all member accounts of a collection |
| `--source-id` | all subcommands | Select one source unambiguously by numeric ID; mutually exclusive with an account argument or `list` scope |
| `--json` | `list`, `show`, `discover`, `import` | Output structured JSON; discovery also suppresses progress |
| `--signal` | `add` | Evidence signal name (default `manual`) |
| `--apply` | `discover` | After the complete preview scan, confirm strong evidence |
| `--provider` | `discover` | Include the authenticated Gmail profile or the source's configured `[[fastmail]]` alias inventory |
| `--confirm <address>` | `discover` | Explicitly confirm one weak candidate; repeatable and requires `--apply` |
| `--file <path>` / `--stdin` | `import` | Read a text or JSON identity list from exactly one input |
| `--signal` | `import` | Evidence signal recorded for imported identities (default `manual`) |
| `--apply` | `import` | Confirm every validated imported identity; without it the command only previews |

Email sync enriches identities already confirmed for the source with strong
sender evidence from trusted Sent metadata; it does not confirm first-time
aliases. Review candidates with `msgvault identity discover` and apply strong
candidates with `msgvault identity discover --apply`. Recipient-only evidence
stays review-only. See [People, Profiles, and Source Identities](/docs/usage/people/)
for classifications, Fastmail inventory, and import formats.

---

## person

Manage durable person profiles and their typed, historized attributes. A
profile can be created by explicitly promoting an observed participant's
identity cluster or by importing contacts from a subscribed CardDAV address book.

```bash
msgvault person promote <participant-id>
msgvault person list [--json]
msgvault person directory [flags]
msgvault person get <person-id> [--json]
msgvault person get --vcard-uid <uid> [--json]
msgvault person identities <person-id> [--json]
msgvault person set-display-name <person-id> <display-name> [--json]
msgvault person set-display-name <person-id> --clear [--json]
msgvault person delete <person-id>
msgvault person merge <survivor-id> <absorbed-id> [flags]
msgvault person split <source-person-id> [flags]
msgvault person merge-history <person-id> [--json]
msgvault person merge-show <merge-id> [--snapshot] [--json]
msgvault person merge-candidate <candidate-id> [flags]

msgvault person attributes list <person-id> [--slug <slug>] [--history] [--json]
msgvault person attributes set <person-id> <slug> (--value <scalar> | --value-json <json|@path|->) [flags]
msgvault person attributes clear <person-id> <slug> [flags]
```

`promote` seeds a new profile with the first nonblank observed name in its
linked cluster, ordered by participant ID. It leaves the name empty when no
member has an observed name. Repeating promotion preserves the saved name,
including an edited or cleared value. `set-display-name` preserves the
profile's stable ID and vCard UID. `delete` permanently retires that UID and
removes the profile's participant bindings. A person with active merge lineage
cannot be deleted until that lineage is fully split.

`person get --vcard-uid` resolves the person's current UID, a retired UID that
still aliases the person after a merge, or a UID on a CardDAV card currently
mapped to that person. This lookup requires daemon API schema 3.10.0 or newer.
JSON person responses
include `vcard_uid` and `carddav_bindings`; each binding names its connection and
address book and includes the resource `href`, `remote_uid`, and `mapping_status`.
Directory JSON includes the same UID and binding fields. Importing a subscribed
CardDAV card adopts its UID when that UID is a UUID (bare or `urn:uuid:`) that no
current, merged, or deleted profile has used. Existing profiles
keep their UID.

`identities` lists the email addresses, phone numbers, and chat identifiers
that the person's current participants have used in your archive, so a merge or
split shows up on the next call. Email addresses are `supported` draft
recipients: pass one to [`draft-compose --to`](#draft-to-a-person). A listed
value keeps the quotes that a local part such as `"first last"` needs. Phone
numbers and chat identifiers are `unsupported`. Curated contact points and
postal addresses are not listed. An unknown or merged-away person fails with
`Person profile not found`. Only the owner can list identities; delegated agent
tokens are refused. The listing does not wait for a running sync or import.

`merge` keeps the survivor's ID and vCard UID, moves the absorbed profile into
it, and records a reversible merge packet. Profiles with active CardDAV
publication are rejected. `split` creates a new person and UID; repeat
`--participant` to select multiple absorbed lineages, or omit it for a merge
whose absorbed profile had no participants.

| Merge flag | Applies to | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--survivor-revision <n>` | `merge` | Required expected revision of the surviving person |
| `--absorbed-revision <n>` | `merge` | Required expected revision of the absorbed person |
| `--idempotency-key <key>` | `merge`, `split` | Required retry key; reusing it with a different request is rejected |
| `--merge-id <id>` | `split` | Required merge record to reverse |
| `--participant <id>` | `split` | Absorbed participant lineage to move; repeat as needed |
| `--revision <n>` | `split`, `merge-candidate` | Required expected revision of the current person |
| `--person-id <id>` | `merge-candidate` | Person that owns the review candidate |
| `--decision <accepted\|rejected>` | `merge-candidate` | Resolve a conflicting single-value attribute |
| `--snapshot` | `merge-show` | Read and verify the immutable merge snapshot |
| `--json` | all merge commands | Output structured JSON |

Exact splits restore the pre-merge profiles when their lineage and referenced
rows remain available. For partial splits, use `--json` to inspect ambiguous or
unrestored rows. Complete merge packets retain merge-time profile values even
after later redaction and require the strongest profile-data options when
copied into a subset. See [People, Profiles, and Source Identities](/docs/usage/people/#merge-duplicate-profiles-and-reverse-a-merge)
for the workflow and lifecycle boundaries.

| Attribute flag | Applies to | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--slug <slug>` | `list` | Restrict output to one definition |
| `--history` | `list` | Include superseded values instead of current values only |
| `--value <scalar>` | `set` | Coerce text, integer, real, boolean, date, or timestamp input to the definition's type |
| `--value-json <json\|@path\|->` | `set` | Supply a structured typed-value envelope |
| `--ordinal <n>` | `set`, `clear` | Address one slot of a multi-valued definition |
| `--source <name>` | `set` | Provenance: `user`, `carddav_import`, `vcard_import`, `archive_observation`, `extraction`, `enrichment`, or `system` |
| `--source-ref <value>` | `set` | Resource or message reference that produced the value |
| `--confidence <0..1>` | `set` | Confidence for a derived or suggested value |
| `--actor <value>` | `set` | Actor recorded with the value |
| `--expected-value-id <id>` | `set`, `clear` | Compare-and-swap guard for the current value |
| `--dry-run` | `set`, `clear` | Validate and preview without writing |
| `--json` | `list`, `set`, `clear` | Output structured JSON |

Setting or clearing a value closes the current history row rather than deleting
it. See [People, Profiles, and Source Identities](/docs/usage/people/) for the
shipped definitions and complete workflow.

## person agenda

Read and organize a person's live Kata tasks. Configure
[`[integrations.kata]`](configuration.md#integrationskata) on the daemon first.
Tasks belong to one person and stay in the configured Kata project.

```bash
msgvault person agenda list <person-id> [--json]
msgvault person agenda create <person-id> --title "Discuss the proposal" [flags]
msgvault person agenda link <person-id> <ref> [--list agenda] [--json]
msgvault person agenda edit <person-id> <ref> --list follow-up [--json]
msgvault person agenda unlink <person-id> <ref> [--json]
```

`<ref>` is a task reference returned by Kata or an agenda command. `create`
creates a task and links it to the person; `link` attaches an existing task.
`edit` changes only its list. `unlink` removes the person link without deleting
the task. Complete or reopen tasks, or edit their title, body, priority, and
labels, in Kata.

| Flag | Commands | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--title` | `create` | — | Required task title |
| `--body` | `create` | — | Task body |
| `--priority` | `create` | — | Kata priority from 0 through 4 |
| `--label` | `create` | — | Kata label; repeat for multiple labels |
| `--list` | `create`, `link`, `edit` | `agenda` for create/link | List name; required for `edit` |
| `--idempotency-key` | `create` | Generated | Stable key to reuse when retrying the same creation |
| `--json` | All agenda commands | `false` | Print the response as JSON |

`create` prints its generated retry key to stderr before sending the request.
To retry, pass that key with `--idempotency-key` and keep the task details the
same. You can also choose the key in advance:

```bash
msgvault person agenda create 42 --title "Discuss the proposal" --idempotency-key proposal-discussion-1
```

`list` returns up to 100 open tasks and recognizes the person's current vCard
UID and aliases. JSON includes `truncated` when more items remain; use Kata to
view the rest. Oversized Kata responses produce an explicit error. See the
[Kata configuration](configuration.md#integrationskata) for metadata and
response limits.

---

## kata

Create Kata issues that quote exact message or file text. Configure
[`[integrations.kata]`](configuration.md#integrationskata) on the daemon first.

```bash
msgvault kata evidence prepare [--input FILE]
msgvault kata create --idempotency-key KEY [--input FILE] [--json]
msgvault kata link <ref> [--input FILE] [--json]
```

Each command reads one JSON request from `--input`, or stdin by default.
`prepare` prints exact excerpts and the references that `create` and `link`
accept. `create` requires `--idempotency-key`, a key you choose to name the
issue; running it again with the same key and input returns the issue it filed
instead of a duplicate.
`link` adds evidence to an existing issue in the configured project, given
as `project#ref` or a bare ref. See [Kata issues](usage/kata-issues.md) for request shapes and limits.

---

## person directory

Browse promoted people by last contact through the selected local or configured remote daemon. The default order is most recent first, `last_contact_desc`. Each page uses the daemon's default of 50 people.

```bash
msgvault person directory
msgvault person directory --last-contact-after 2026-06-01 --last-contact-before 2026-07-01 --json
msgvault person directory --sort last_contact_asc
msgvault person directory --sort name
msgvault person directory --last-contact-after 2026-06-01 --cursor "<next_cursor>"
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--last-contact-after <date>` | absent | Inclusive lower bound, `YYYY-MM-DD` or RFC3339 |
| `--last-contact-before <date>` | absent | Inclusive upper bound, `YYYY-MM-DD` or RFC3339 |
| `--sort <order>` | `last_contact_desc` | `name`, `last_contact_desc`, or `last_contact_asc` |
| `--cursor <cursor>` | absent | Opaque `next_cursor` from the previous page |
| `--json` | `false` | Output the full Directory page envelope |

Date-only bounds mean midnight UTC on that date. RFC3339 bounds accept offsets and fractional seconds. Both bounds include the specified instant, so `--last-contact-before 2026-07-01` includes midnight at the start of July 1. Use a timestamp when you need a different cutoff.

Human output shows `ID`, `DISPLAY NAME`, and `LAST CONTACT` in daemon order. Timestamps use UTC RFC3339 at seconds precision; JSON preserves fractional seconds. Missing display names and timestamps show `-`. A page with more results prints `Next cursor`. Pass that value unchanged to `--cursor` and repeat the same bounds and sort to continue.

JSON contains a `people` array and optional `next_cursor`. Each person retains the Directory fields, including categories, organizations, contact state, ID, revision, `vcard_uid`, and `carddav_bindings`. Optional fields stay absent when the daemon omits them, including `last_contact_at` for people without a contact timestamp. `person list` continues to return the full unpaginated profile collection, with its existing human columns and JSON array output.

---

## person provider add

Create and synthetically check a named people inference profile. Select a
built-in preset to bind its protocol, endpoint, and authentication scheme:

```bash
msgvault person provider add primary --provider openrouter --model <model> \
  --credential-env OPENROUTER_API_KEY --retention-posture <assertion> \
  --training-posture <assertion> --source conversation_text \
  --source-since 2026-01-01 --allow-sensitive=true --yes
msgvault person provider consent primary --yes
msgvault person provider use primary
```

`--provider` accepts `openai`, `openrouter`, or `venice` and requires an explicit
model and privacy policy. It cannot be combined with `--custom` or
`--accept-catalog-prices`; conflicting protocol, endpoint, or auth overrides
are rejected. `--credential-env` reads only the named host variable. Alternatively,
`--api-key-stdin` reads a key from standard input, or an interactive terminal
prompts for it. A successful synthetic check does not grant consent or select
the profile. See [profile automation](usage/people-automation.md) for custom
protocol profiles and policy fields.

## person provider enroll-codex

Create, check, consent to, and select a new Codex profile through the daemon.
**Codex enrollment is unavailable in this release:** no Codex build is approved.
The daemon returns HTTP 503 before changing credentials or consent. This command
requires a terminal and never starts a noninteractive device login.

```bash
msgvault person provider enroll-codex <new-name> \
  --retention-posture <assertion> --training-posture <assertion> \
  --source conversation_text --source-since 2026-01-01 --allow-sensitive=true
```

The gated flow prints a verification URL, user code, and local deadline, waits
for sign-in, then prompts for an available model and reasoning effort. Existing
profile names are rejected. After saving, a synthetic check and separate
consent are required before selection. Declining consent leaves the saved
profile unselected. Restart the daemon when the reported running profile differs.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--model` | prompt | Codex model ID available to the signed-in account |
| `--reasoning-effort` | prompt | Supported effort for the chosen model |
| `--retention-posture`, `--training-posture` | required | Explicit operator assertions |
| `--source` | required | Repeatable: `conversation_text`, `meeting_text`, or `document_text` |
| `--source-since` | required | Earliest disclosed date, `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `--source-until` | absent | Latest disclosed date, on or after `--source-since` |
| `--allow-sensitive` | explicit decision required | `true` permits archive evidence; `false` permits only synthetic checks |
| `--yes` | `false` | Confirm the displayed check disclosure and select the profile without a consent prompt |

Host-side `person provider login` reauthenticates the selected existing Codex
profile; `person provider models` lists its models and reasoning efforts. Both
accept `--json` and remain unavailable behind the same release gate. See
[Codex configuration](configuration.md#codex-app-server-profiles).

## person provider status

Show the exact people inference provider policy and its check and consent state.
The JSON output includes the selected profile `name` and adds
`stale_program_check` or `stale_program_consent` when a verified historical record matches every policy field except the extraction
program and supplies a missing current gate. Human output identifies a
different extraction program and gives the recovery command without provider
credentials or response content.

```bash
msgvault person provider status [name] [--json]
```

## person provider reverify

Run the existing synthetic provider check, then grant consent for the same
current exact provider profile. The check must succeed before consent is
granted. The command prints the provider disclosure and asks for confirmation
unless `--yes` is supplied.

```bash
msgvault person provider reverify [name] --yes [--json]
```

Omit `name` to use the active provider, as with `check` and `consent`.
`--yes` confirms the disclosure. Human output includes the disclosure even with
`--yes`; `--json` returns the final exact check and consent status. The named
profile can be disabled in configuration, and this command still selects it for the operation without enabling scheduled sweeps.

---

## person brief

Read a short summary before your next conversation with someone, or generate a
new one from their recent supported chat and text messages.

```bash
msgvault person brief enroll <person-id> [--track] [--json]
msgvault person brief generate <person-id> [--json]
msgvault person brief show <person-id> [--json]
msgvault person brief history <person-id> [--limit 20] [--json]
msgvault person brief reject <person-id> [--reason "..."] [--json]
msgvault person brief unenroll <person-id> [--json]
```

Enrollment requires tracking; `--track` enables both. Generation uses the
consented provider and its budget. History accepts limits from 1 to 200;
rejection hides the current version but preserves it in history. Unenrolling
stops future generation without deleting saved versions.

See [person briefs](usage/people-briefs.md)
for provider setup, supported sources, and a first-run example.

---

## person provider set

Update the mutable policy fields of an existing named people inference provider
profile in place. The protocol, endpoint, auth scheme, credential source,
executable, execution boundary, selection, and enablement stay unchanged.

```bash
msgvault person provider set <name> --model <model> [flags]
```

The command reruns the exact synthetic provider check and revokes consent for
the previous fingerprint. Grant fresh consent with
`msgvault person provider consent <name> --yes` after reviewing the updated
policy. A running local daemon requires `msgvault daemon restart` before its
scheduled sweeps observe the change. Configured remote daemons refuse this
mutation; run it on the daemon host or pass `--local`.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--model` | unchanged | Provider model identifier |
| `--retention-posture` | unchanged | Provider retention assertion |
| `--training-posture` | unchanged | Provider training assertion |
| `--source` | unchanged | Allowed source class; repeatable, replaces the existing list |
| `--source-since` | unchanged | Earliest disclosed source date |
| `--source-until` | unchanged | Latest disclosed source date |
| `--allow-sensitive` | unchanged | Allow sensitive text in provider packets |
| `--reasoning-effort` | unchanged | Explicit reasoning effort |
| `--reasoning-mode` | unchanged | Explicit reasoning mode |
| `--request-timeout` | unchanged | Provider request timeout |
| `--yes` | `false` | Confirm the final provider and privacy values; required |
| `--json` | `false` | Output structured JSON |

---

## attribute-definition

Manage portable field metadata. Definitions add no runtime database columns;
their universal IDs and slugs remain stable while labels and descriptions may
change.

```bash
msgvault attribute-definition list [--object-type person|organization] [--include-hidden] [--json]
msgvault attribute-definition get <definition-id> [--json]
msgvault attribute-definition create --definition <json|@path|-> [--dry-run] [--json]
msgvault attribute-definition rename <definition-id> [--label <text>] [--description <text> | --clear-description] [--json]
msgvault attribute-definition delete <definition-id>
```

`create --dry-run` performs local structural validation but cannot detect a
conflict with definitions already stored by the daemon. `rename` does not
change the immutable slug or universal ID. Deletion is limited to user-created,
deletable definitions that have no stored values.

---

## collection

Manage named groups of accounts.

The collection subcommands use the configured remote server or local daemon by
default. `--local` uses the local daemon even when a remote is configured.

```bash
msgvault collection create <name> --accounts <account1,account2,...>
msgvault collection list
msgvault collection show <name>
msgvault collection add <name> --accounts <account1,account2,...>
msgvault collection remove <name> --accounts <account1,account2,...>
msgvault collection delete <name>
```

Deleting a collection does not delete sources or messages.

---

## deduplicate

Find and merge duplicate messages within an account or collection.

```bash
msgvault deduplicate [flags]
```

By default, each source is deduplicated independently. `--collection` is the explicit opt-in for cross-source deduplication.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | Scan and report only; do not hide duplicates |
| `--account` | Scope dedup to one account |
| `--collection` | Dedup across every member account of a collection |
| `--content-hash` | Also detect duplicates by normalized raw MIME content |
| `--prefer` | Comma-separated source type preference order |
| `--undo <batch-id>` | Restore rows hidden by a previous dedup run; repeatable |
| `--delete-dups-from-source-server` | Stage same-source pruned duplicates for remote deletion |
| `--no-backup` | Skip the database backup before merging |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Skip confirmation prompt |

---

## delete-deduped

Permanently delete dedup-hidden messages from the selected msgvault archive.

```bash
msgvault delete-deduped --batch <batch-id>
msgvault delete-deduped --all-hidden
```

The CLI sends the request to the configured remote daemon, or to the
auto-started local daemon when no remote is configured. It no longer opens the
SQLite database directly. The delete cannot be undone with `deduplicate --undo`;
when backups are enabled, the daemon writes the backup next to the database it
owns before deleting. Repeated `--batch` selections commit as one transaction;
if the request is canceled, none of the selected batches are left half-deleted.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--batch` | Delete rows hidden by this dedup batch ID; repeatable |
| `--all-hidden` | Delete every dedup-hidden row regardless of batch |
| `--no-backup` | Skip database backup before deleting |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Skip confirmation prompt (`--all-hidden` still prompts) |

---

## list-senders

List top senders by message count.

```bash
msgvault list-senders [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-n`, `--limit N` | Number of results (default: 50) |
| `--after YYYY-MM-DD` | Only messages after this date |
| `--before YYYY-MM-DD` | Only messages before this date |
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

---

## list-domains

List top sender domains by message count.

```bash
msgvault list-domains [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-n`, `--limit N` | Number of results (default: 50) |
| `--after YYYY-MM-DD` | Only messages after this date |
| `--before YYYY-MM-DD` | Only messages before this date |
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

---

## list-labels

List all labels with message counts.

```bash
msgvault list-labels [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-n`, `--limit N` | Number of results (default: 50) |
| `--after YYYY-MM-DD` | Only messages after this date |
| `--before YYYY-MM-DD` | Only messages before this date |
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

---

## build-cache

Build or update the Parquet analytics cache through the configured remote server
or the local daemon.

```bash
msgvault build-cache [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--full-rebuild` | Rebuild all cache files from scratch |

The CLI sends the request over HTTP and streams the daemon's stdout/stderr back
to the terminal. A local daemon runs the DuckDB export in an isolated child
process so DuckDB's bundled SQLite library never opens the archive inside the
long-lived daemon process. With `[remote].url` configured, the remote daemon
builds its own cache; use `--local` only to target this machine's local daemon.

For automatic cache rebuilds after daemon-owned syncs, configure
`[analytics].auto_build_cache` in `config.toml`. See
[analytics settings](configuration.md#analytics) for snapshot freshness,
builder memory, threads, and temporary disk limits.

Build warnings count exported text values repaired with U+FFFD and identity
values exported as unknown. Invalid source message IDs, source conversation
IDs, and source identifiers export as empty strings; valid keys stay unchanged.
Invalid List-IDs export as NULL; see [List-Id recovery](#repair-list-ids).
The counts cover only datasets written by that build or refresh, on every
platform. A source value written to two output
columns counts twice; repeated identity comparisons do not add to the count.
See [encoding repair limits](#repair-encoding) for archive recovery.

---

## activity

Refresh contact activity and last-contact dates from archived messages.

```bash
msgvault activity build
msgvault activity build --backstop
```

The normal build resumes from its watermark. `--backstop` rescans the complete
archive. `msgvault serve` also runs this projection on the schedule configured
under `[activity]`.

---

## rebuild-fts

Rebuild the SQLite FTS5 search index.

```bash
msgvault rebuild-fts
```

Use this if `verify` reports FTS5 shadow-table corruption such as a malformed inverted index. The command rebuilds the search index from the canonical `messages` table.

---

## embeddings

Manage the vector embedding index used by `--mode vector` and `--mode hybrid` search. Requires a build with a vector backend (`sqlite_vec` for SQLite archives, `pgvector` for PostgreSQL archives) and a configured `[vector.embeddings]` endpoint. See [Vector Search](/docs/usage/vector-search/) for prerequisites, model rotation, and troubleshooting.

```bash
msgvault embeddings <subcommand> [flags]
```

| Subcommand | Description |
|---|---|
| `build` | Build or update the index. Incremental by default; `--full-rebuild` starts a new generation. |
| `resume` | Continue scan-and-fill embedding for the building or active generation. Incremental by default; `--backstop` also scans below the watermark. |
| `list` | List index generations with their state, model, dimension, and pending count. |
| `optimize [generation-id]` | Build or resume the local SQLite search accelerator, or remove it with `--drop`. |
| `prune` | Remove embeddings for hard-deleted messages. |
| `activate <generation-id>` | Activate a completed building generation, retiring the current active one. |
| `retire <generation-id>` | Retire a generation. |
| `prune` | Remove embeddings whose messages were hard-deleted. |

### embeddings build

```bash
msgvault embeddings build [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--full-rebuild` | Create a new index generation and rebuild from scratch. The new generation is activated atomically once coverage reaches zero. Same-model rebuilds keep serving the previous active generation in the meantime, but active-generation top-ups are frozen until activation; model or dimension changes return `index_stale` for vector/hybrid search until the new generation activates. |
| `--yes` | Skip the confirmation prompt that `--full-rebuild` otherwise requires. |
| `--backstop` | Run a full-scan pass that ignores the per-generation watermark to recover missing coverage skipped by incremental scans. Already-covered messages are skipped. |
| `--account <identifier>` | Limit embedding to this account, by identifier or display name — numeric source IDs are rejected (repeatable). Overrides `[vector.embed.scope] accounts` for this run; configured `message_types` still apply. After activating this one-off scope, add the equivalent accounts to config and restart the daemon before searching. |
| `--collection <name>` | Limit embedding to this collection's accounts (repeatable). Can be combined with `--account`; the scope is the union. This is a one-run override; persist the resolved accounts in config before restarting the daemon. |

Without `--full-rebuild`, the command is incremental: it resumes any in-flight rebuild that matches the configured embedding settings, otherwise scans for live messages still missing coverage in the active generation, then exits. Safe to schedule via cron (or let `msgvault serve` do it via `[vector.embed.schedule]`).

The account scope is part of the generation fingerprint, so building with a
different `--account`/`--collection` set than the active generation requires
`--full-rebuild`, exactly like changing the model. See
[Scoped Generations](/docs/usage/vector-search/#scoped-generations).

### embeddings resume

```bash
msgvault embeddings resume [flags]
```

Continue embedding work and finish the current generation. If a generation matching the configured embedding settings is building, this embeds its remaining rows and activates it once coverage reaches zero; otherwise it tops up the active generation. Equivalent to `msgvault embeddings build` with no flags, but never starts a full rebuild. Accepts the same `--account`/`--collection` scope flags as `embeddings build`.

Pass `--backstop` to scan for missing coverage below the per-generation watermark
as well. This fills gaps in the selected generation without starting a full
rebuild; it only activates a generation if that generation is building.

```bash
msgvault embeddings resume --backstop
```

### embeddings list

```bash
msgvault embeddings list
```

Print one row per index generation: ID, generation state, model, dimension,
coverage, accelerator state and row count, accelerator timestamps and last
error, fingerprint, and generation timestamps.

Listing only reads existing metadata, so it works while other jobs hold the
archive. If the metadata still needs an upgrade, it fails and asks you to run
`msgvault daemon restart`, which applies the upgrade when vector search is
enabled.

### embeddings optimize

```bash
msgvault embeddings optimize [generation-id] [--drop]
```

Build or resume the SQLite approximate-search accelerator from vectors already
stored for a generation. The active generation is used when the ID is omitted.
The command never calls the embedding provider. It is safe to interrupt and
rerun; the accelerator is not used for search until verification and atomic
publication complete. The daemon's operation gate pauses scheduled embedding
and other gated writes until the command finishes. Searches remain available.
PostgreSQL does not need this command.

Use `--drop` to remove the accelerator and its build state, including for a
retired generation. Exact vectors remain intact. Freed database pages become
reusable; the database file does not shrink. Re-run optimization after substantial
archive growth to retrain its fixed bucket count.

### embeddings prune

```bash
msgvault embeddings prune
```

Remove stored message embeddings whose source messages were hard-deleted.

### embeddings activate

```bash
msgvault embeddings activate <generation-id> [flags]
```

Activate a completed building generation and retire the currently active one. By default this refuses to activate a generation that still has messages missing coverage or whose fingerprint does not match the current config.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--yes` | Skip the confirmation prompt. |
| `--force` | Activate even with missing coverage or a fingerprint mismatch. |

### embeddings retire

```bash
msgvault embeddings retire <generation-id> [flags]
```

Mark a generation as retired. Retiring the active generation requires `--force-active`, since it leaves no generation serving vector/hybrid search.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--yes` | Skip the confirmation prompt. |
| `--force-active` | Allow retiring the generation that is currently active. |

### embeddings prune

```bash
msgvault embeddings prune
```

Remove vector rows whose source messages no longer exist. The configured
vector backend must support orphan pruning.

`msgvault build-embeddings` remains as a deprecated alias for `msgvault embeddings build` (same `--full-rebuild` and `--yes` flags).

---

## multimodal

Build, inspect, and search the optional visual attachment index. The workflow
requires `[vector.multimodal]` configuration, a probed capability manifest,
and explicit consent for hosted processing. See [Visual attachment
search](usage/vector-search.md#visual-attachment-search).

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `probe --seeds <dir> --out <file> --yes` | Send synthetic fixtures to the configured provider and write a capability manifest. `--fixtures` keeps the generated fixtures instead of using a temporary directory. |
| `build --yes` | Record consent for the configured capability profile and build the visual index. |
| `resume` | Continue a consented build. |
| `status [--json]` | Report generation state and coverage. |
| `retry --message <id> --hash <sha256>` | Retry one attachment occurrence. |
| `retire <generation-id> --yes` | Retire one generation and delete its vectors. Original attachments remain archived. |

Search by text or by one local JPEG, PNG, or WebP image:

```bash
msgvault multimodal search "a whiteboard timeline"
msgvault multimodal search --image ./reference.png
```

| Search flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--image <path>` | — | Use a local query image of at most 20 MiB instead of text |
| `--limit <count>` | `20` | Results to return; must be 1–100 |
| `--cursor <value>` | — | Continue from an opaque result cursor |
| `--sender-person <id>` | — | Attachments sent by one durable person |
| `--person <id>` | — | Attachments related to one durable person |
| `--participant <id>` | — | Attachments related to one observed participant |
| `--direction <value>` | — | `from_person`, `to_person`, or `group`; requires `--person` or `--participant` |
| `--source <id>` | — | Restrict to one source |
| `--message <id>` | — | Restrict to one owning message |
| `--filename <text>` | — | Case-insensitive filename substring |
| `--mime-prefix <text>` | — | Case-insensitive MIME prefix |
| `--after`, `--before` | — | `YYYY-MM-DD` sent-date bounds |
| `--json` | `false` | Emit JSON |

Supply exactly one text query or `--image`. `--person` and `--participant` are
mutually exclusive. `--sender-person` cannot be combined with either of those
or with `--direction`.

---

## eval

Compare how well search modes find messages you have rated. The command runs
the same full-text, vector, and hybrid retrieval paths used by production
search. It reports ranking quality, recall, latency, configuration, and input
diagnostics.

```text
# topics.tsv: qid<TAB>query<TAB>optional-category
q1	quarterly planning	pointed
```

```text
# qrels.txt: qid iteration document-id relevance (1 or greater means relevant)
# Replace example-message-001 with a real source_message_id, not a local numeric ID.
q1 0 example-message-001 2
```

```bash
msgvault eval \
  --topics topics.tsv \
  --qrels qrels.txt \
  --modes fts,vector,hybrid \
  --limit 100
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--topics <path>` | required | Tab-separated topics: `qid`, query, and optional category |
| `--qrels <path>` | required | Whitespace-separated judgments: `qid iteration docid relevance`; relevance of 1 or greater means relevant |
| `--modes <list>` | `fts,vector,hybrid` | Comma-separated modes to evaluate |
| `--doc-key <kind>` | `message` | Match judgments to `message` source IDs or `conversation` source IDs |
| `-n`, `--limit <count>` | `100` | Distinct documents retrieved per query |
| `--json` | `false` | Emit the report as JSON |
| `--rerank-jev <shapes>` | disabled | Opt in to `per-candidate`, `batched`, or both Jev shapes |
| `--rerank-top <count>` | `30` | Between 2 and 30 candidates; cannot exceed `--limit` |
| `--rerank-max-requests <count>` | `1000` | Maximum provider requests for the whole invocation |
| `--rerank-input-usd-per-million <amount>` | required when enabled | Input price supplied for this run |
| `--rerank-output-usd-per-million <amount>` | required when enabled | Output price supplied for this run |

`eval` opens the archive selected by local configuration directly; it does not
use `[remote]`. Vector and hybrid evaluation currently require a SQLite archive,
an `sqlite_vec` build, enabled vector configuration, and a compatible active
generation. On PostgreSQL, run `--modes fts`.

### Optional Jev reranking

`--rerank-jev` adds an evaluation arm after retrieval. It sends the topic query
and up to 30 message candidates to TypeSafe's fixed Jev endpoint. The command
uses `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` from the process environment. Selecting a shape is the
per-invocation consent to send that archived text. The reranked arms accept
`--doc-key=message` because TREC judgments identify messages. Conversation
judgments remain available for the baseline run.

The command prepares candidate text with the same body selection and cleanup
used for embeddings. It sends only the query and the cleaned subject/body.
Candidate text is capped at 2048 UTF-8 bytes and query text at 4096 bytes.
Msgvault calls TypeSafe through Docbank's `document/typesafe` client, which
sets the request and response size limits and runs at most eight calls at
once. Msgvault gives each ranking 40 seconds for all of its calls, enough for
four waves of 10-second calls at 30 candidates. A ranking's full elapsed time
contributes to the reported latency. The `per-candidate` and `batched` shapes
use the same retrieved messages in one invocation.

Cost is the returned input and output tokens times the prices supplied on the
command line. Before opening the archive, the command refuses a run whose
worst-case request count, judged topics times modes times requests per
ranking, exceeds `--rerank-max-requests`. Msgvault has no local spend limit,
so before a live study, verify an account or order limit that TypeSafe
enforces by rejecting charges above the cap. A displayed balance or alert does
not establish that behavior. A response without token usage fails that arm.
The first provider failure ends reranking for the run. The report keeps the
baseline and the token subtotals observed before the failure,
`usage_complete=false` marks them as partial, and unknown cost prints `unknown`
in the table and `null` in JSON. Requests and tokens count completed rankings
only. The command returns a nonzero result.

Example with placeholder prices:

```bash
TYPESAFE_API_KEY=replace-me msgvault eval \
  --topics topics.tsv --qrels qrels.txt --modes fts,vector,hybrid \
  --limit 100 --rerank-jev per-candidate,batched --rerank-top 30 \
  --rerank-input-usd-per-million 1 \
  --rerank-output-usd-per-million 2
```

Reranked p95 includes retrieval, shared candidate preparation, and that shape's
provider calls. A live TREC Legal 2010 study also needs a permitted matching
message collection, topics, qrels, source-id mapping, and the enforced account
cap. Consider a search integration only when a complete hybrid shape improves
Hit@10 by 0.05 absolute and has end-to-end p95 at or below 2000 ms under the
same corpus, topics, qrels, retrieval settings, and top N of 30. Report the
paired topic denominator and changes for both shapes. The local threaded
fixture checks wiring only.

---

## cache-stats

Show statistics about the analytics cache.

```bash
msgvault cache-stats
```

The command queries the configured msgvault server over HTTP. With local configuration,
the CLI auto-starts or reuses the local daemon, and the daemon reads the analytics
cache files. With remote configuration, the remote server reports its own cache state.

---

## query

Run arbitrary SQL against the Parquet analytics cache using an in-memory DuckDB engine.

```bash
msgvault query <sql> [flags]
```

A usable stale cache remains queryable while refresh work runs. The JSON result
includes `cache.published_at`, and includes `stale_reason` and
`pending_additions` when known. If a new publication is required before rows
can be returned, the command reports the build job on stderr, waits for it,
then returns query results. A failed build or interrupted wait exits with an
error. `--fresh` waits for a check that includes archive writes committed before
the request, rebuilding if needed, before returning rows.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--format` | `json` | Output format: `json`, `csv`, or `table` |
| `--fresh` | `false` | Wait for a freshness check and any required rebuild before returning rows |

See [SQL Queries](/docs/usage/querying/) for available views and example queries.

---

## credentials

On unreleased `main`, manage provider keys on the daemon host without the Web UI:

```sh
msgvault credentials set <id> --from-file PATH [--endpoint URL]
msgvault credentials set <id> --stdin [--endpoint URL]
msgvault credentials list [--json]
msgvault credentials import-env
```

Supply exactly one input source. Supported IDs are `vector.embeddings`,
`vector.multimodal`, `people.enrichment/<name>`, and
`people.enrichment/suppression`. The configured provider supplies the default
endpoint. Suppression keys have no endpoint. Listing prints IDs and bound
origins, never key values. Import copies present configured environment keys
and preserves stored keys. See [stored credentials](configuration.md#stored-provider-credentials)
for input security, runtime precedence, and sweep-provider commands.

## mcp

### Discover running HTTP listeners

Run `msgvault mcp status --json` to list HTTP MCP listeners started by this
version. The command reads local runtime records without starting a server.
Each entry includes `transport`, `url`, `pid`, `backend_url` when known,
and `token_path` when the listener requires a bearer token. Read the token
from that private file; the status output does not print it.

The listener publishes its actual bound port after startup, including when
started with port zero, and removes its record on orderly shutdown. Status
omits records whose process has exited or whose process-start identity cannot
be verified, including when another process reuses the PID. Stdio sessions are
not listening endpoints and do not appear. An empty JSON list means no HTTP
listeners were found in this application's configured data directory.

Start the Model Context Protocol server for AI assistant integration.

Draft tools prepare and manage drafts through the selected daemon, using the same commands and permissions as the CLI. Msgvault never sends. A daemon with API schema 3.0.0 or newer exposes eight draft tools to the owner.

With `--agent-url` and `--agent-token-file`, `msgvault mcp` exposes scoped read tools on daemons with API schema 3.9.0 or newer, the six delegated draft tools, and calendar tools on daemons with API schema 3.1.0 or newer, over stdio. The daemon checks the token's permissions and source scope on every call. Delegated sessions refuse `--http`.

```bash
msgvault mcp [flags]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--force-sql` | `false` | Deprecated in 0.17.0; use `[analytics].engine = "sql"` in `config.toml` instead. See [Configuration: analytics](/docs/configuration/#analytics). |
| `--no-sqlite-scanner` | `false` | Deprecated in 0.17.0; cache engine selection is daemon-managed. Use `[analytics].engine = "sql"` for live SQL. |
| `--http` | — | Serve MCP over StreamableHTTP on this address instead of stdio. Bare ports bind to loopback, e.g. `8080` becomes `127.0.0.1:8080`. Non-loopback addresses require an effective inbound key or `--http-allow-insecure`. |
| `--http-token-file` | — | On unreleased `main`, read an independent inbound bearer key from an owner-only file; takes priority over `--http-token-env`. Requires `--http`. |
| `--http-token-env` | — | On unreleased `main`, name the environment variable holding an independent inbound bearer key. Requires `--http`. |
| `--http-allow-insecure` | `false` | Allow non-loopback HTTP binding without an effective inbound key. A configured key is still enforced; without one, use only behind a trusted network boundary or authenticated reverse proxy. |
| `--http-allow-writes` | `false` | Expose Saved View management, attachment export, deletion staging, and managed draft writes over StreamableHTTP. Calendar event mutations also require `--allow-calendar-writes`, and Kata issue writes `--allow-kata-writes`. Enable only for trusted, authenticated clients. |
| `--allow-calendar-writes` | `false` | Expose calendar event mutation tools. HTTP also requires `--http-allow-writes`; only enable for sessions where the user explicitly authorizes calendar writes. |
| `--allow-kata-writes` | `false` | Expose `create_kata_issue` and `link_kata_evidence`. HTTP also requires `--http-allow-writes`; archive text is untrusted input, so only enable for sessions where the user explicitly authorizes Kata issue writes. See [Kata issues](usage/kata-issues.md). |

See [MCP Server](/docs/usage/chat/) for configuration and tool reference.

For Kata person agendas, `get_person_agenda` reads the live open tasks and
returns the person's canonical vCard UID and aliases. Use Kata's MCP tools to
create or change tasks; msgvault's agenda tool is read-only. Use the returned
canonical UID as the scalar `msgvault.person` metadata value and
`msgvault.list` for the list name (`agenda` by default). See
[Kata configuration](configuration.md#integrationskata) for setup and limits.

---

## skills

Install or remove the bundled msgvault agent skills:

```bash
msgvault skills install
msgvault skills uninstall
```

Install detects Claude Code and Codex from `~/.claude` and `~/.codex`, then
writes the `msgvault-search`, `msgvault-attachments`, and
`msgvault-analytics` skills to their user-level skill directories. Existing
generated copies are updated in place; files without msgvault's generation
marker are preserved unless `--force` is supplied.

| Install flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--agent claude` / `--agent codex` | Restrict installation to one or more detected agents; repeat or comma-separate values |
| `--dir <path>` | Install into an explicit skill directory instead of detected agents |
| `--force` | Overwrite skill files that no longer carry the msgvault generation marker |

`skills uninstall` accepts `--agent` and `--dir` with the same target
semantics, and removes only generated copies that still carry the marker. See
[Agent Skills](/docs/guides/agent-skills/) for the workflow and safety model.

---

## openapi

Print the checked-in msgvault OpenAPI contract without starting the daemon or opening the archive database.

```bash
msgvault openapi [flags]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--version` | `3.1` | OpenAPI version to emit: `3.1` or `3.0` |
| `--format` | `yaml` | Output format: `yaml` or `json` |

The OpenAPI `info.version` is the API schema version, not the msgvault binary version. Use it to reason about forward/backward compatibility when a local or remote CLI talks to a server. The running daemon also serves the same contract at `/openapi.json`; generated client artifacts are built from the OpenAPI 3.0 form for tool compatibility.

---

## daemon

Manage the local background daemon used by HTTP-backed CLI commands.

```bash
msgvault daemon start
msgvault daemon status
msgvault daemon stop
msgvault daemon restart
```

`start` launches the daemon in the background, `status` reports its recorded URL/PID/version/API schema/uptime, `stop` shuts it down, and `restart` performs a stop followed by a start. Starting a newer compatible binary replaces an older recorded daemon when `[server].daemon_auto_restart = "newer"`; incompatible running daemons are reported with a prompt to stop them first.

The lifecycle commands have no command-specific flags. Configuration comes from `config.toml` with the [runtime environment overrides](configuration.md#environment-variables). See [Web UI & API Server](/docs/api-server/) for endpoint documentation, run `msgvault openapi`, or fetch `/openapi.json` from a running server for the generated OpenAPI contract. See [Configuration](/docs/configuration/#server) for config options. When vector search is enabled, the daemon can also run the embed worker on a cron and/or after every successful sync, see [Configuration: vector.embed.schedule](/docs/configuration/#vectorembedschedule).

Background daemons started by `daemon start` or auto-started by a CLI command shut down after `[server].daemon_idle_timeout` with no requests. The default is `20m`; set it to `"0s"` to disable idle shutdown. `MSGVAULT_DAEMON_IDLE_TIMEOUT` can override the value for a lifecycle-managed background daemon.

`[server].daemon_auto_restart` controls local daemon replacement when the CLI and recorded daemon versions differ. The default `newer` restarts only older compatible daemons, `never` leaves lifecycle to the operator or supervisor, and `always` restarts on any version mismatch that is safe for the current API schema.

For compatibility with existing scripts, `msgvault serve start|status|stop|restart` remains accepted without warnings, but these aliases are hidden from help and shell completion.

---

## serve

Start the Web UI and API server with optional background sync scheduling in the foreground.

```bash
msgvault serve
```

`msgvault serve` stays in the foreground until interrupted and is not idle-stopped. Use it for externally supervised, Docker, and NAS deployments; use `msgvault daemon` for local background lifecycle management.

On unreleased `main`, `--bind ADDRESS` and `--port PORT` override environment,
TOML, and defaults. A port of `0` selects an open port. `--bind iface:NAME`
resolves a named network interface at startup and fails before binding if it
cannot find a usable address. See [runtime configuration](configuration.md#environment-variables)
for environment-only deployment and persisted API keys.

```sh
msgvault serve --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

---

## setup

Run the first-run setup wizard. It writes `config.toml`, optionally stores a Google OAuth credential (needed only for Gmail and Google Calendar; press Enter to skip), and optionally configures a remote deployment.

```bash
msgvault setup
```

If configured for a remote server, this command generates `<MSGVAULT_HOME>/nas-bundle` with:

- `config.toml` ready for container deployment
- `client_secret.json`, if a Google OAuth credential is configured
- `docker-compose.yml`

The wizard also stores remote URL/API key in `remote` config block so `export-token` can use it without extra flags.

### setup providers

Configure optional search and people features from the available API keys. The
command reads `VOYAGE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and the document provider's
configured key variable (default `MISTRAL_API_KEY`). For an unset text feature,
it chooses Voyage contextual embeddings, then OpenAI embeddings, then an
available loopback Ollama model at `[chat].server`. Hosted people inference
requires an explicit `--provider` and `--model`; an OpenAI key alone does not
select it. Without an OpenAI key or explicit provider choice, setup can offer
the configured local Ollama chat model. The running daemon does not fall back
to another provider after a failure.

Setup prints a plan, asks once per hosted provider, writes `config.toml`, and
prints the remaining commands. It onboards a new people-sweep provider through
the same check and consent gates as `person provider`. Other feature-specific
consents remain separate. Visual search needs a valid probe manifest before
setup enables it; document extraction remains manual. See
[Recommended Configuration](usage/recommended-configuration.md).

Local people-sweep setup stays pending unless `--allow-sensitive` is supplied.
An explicit `--provider` requires `--allow-sensitive=true|false` and explicit
`--retention-posture` and `--training-posture` assertions. Only `true` permits
sending sensitive archive excerpts and inferring sensitive personal attributes;
`false` permits the synthetic check but real sweeps cannot process evidence.
`--yes` alone does not grant this permission. If a sweep is already enabled,
`--provider` is rejected; use `person provider add` and `person provider use`
to choose another profile. Vector lanes also stay pending when the binary lacks the backend
required by the configured database; setup prints rebuild guidance.

Saved retention and training postures on disabled lanes are preserved unless
their corresponding posture flags are explicitly supplied. Custom hosted text
endpoints require explicit configuration of dependent lanes. Document semantic
search requires both `documents vectors consent --yes` and
`documents vectors consent --purpose queries --yes`; the latter authorizes
query-text uploads. The status report tracks the two purposes separately.

An existing text model or endpoint is preserved even if the feature is disabled.
Setup does not replace it when a different key appears. Explicit text and visual
schedule keys, including an empty cron and `run_after_sync = false`, are also
preserved. Setup does not configure source syncs, track people, enroll briefs,
or set provider prices and monetary caps.

```bash
msgvault setup providers --dry-run
msgvault setup providers
msgvault setup providers --allow-sensitive
msgvault setup providers --yes --document-retention zdr --document-training opted-out
```

| `--credential-env` | absent | Host environment-variable name for the preset key; mutually exclusive with `--api-key-stdin` |
| `--api-key-stdin` | `false` | Read the preset API key from standard input; otherwise a terminal can prompt for it |
| `--yes`                | `false`             | Accept every provider disclosure without prompting. Required to apply a plan with hosted-provider prompts when stdin is not a terminal or `--json` is used. It does not grant the separate sensitive-data opt-in. |
| `--allow-sensitive`    | `false`             | Allow the people sweep to send sensitive archive excerpts and infer sensitive personal attributes                                                                                                                 |
| `--dry-run`            | `false`             | Print the plan, the disclosures, and the current lane report without writing                                                                                                                                      |
| `--document-retention` | `standard`          | Mistral retention posture to record: `standard` or `zdr`                                                                                                                                                          |
| `--document-training`  | `default-opt-out`   | Mistral training posture to record: `default-opt-out` or `opted-out`                                                                                                                                              |
| `--retention-posture`  | `provider-declared` | Retention assertion recorded for embedding and inference providers                                                                                                                                                |

| `--json`               | `false`             | Output the plan, applied flag, follow-ups, and report as JSON                                                                                                                                                     |

The command edits the config file on this machine and refuses to run against a
configured remote daemon; run it on the daemon host or pass `--local`.

### setup status

Report the setup state of each feature (text search, semantic people search,
visual attachments, documents, document vectors, people sweep, activity
projection, media policy): state, provider, model, recorded consent, schedule,
the reason a lane is off, and the command that turns it on. Reads `config.toml`,
the environment, and the local archive's consent records; never contacts a
provider. Stored provider credentials are checked too. An `on` state means the
setup checks passed; it does not prove that an index has been built or that a
provider will answer. The MCP summary is a partial list derived from enabled
configuration flags, not the live server's `tools/list` response. Use the
feature's status command or [Web Operations](web-ui.md#operations) to inspect
index progress and coverage.

```bash
msgvault setup status
msgvault setup status --json
```

---

## show-message

Show full message details.

```bash
msgvault show-message <id> [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

JSON output includes `web_url` when the selected daemon can provide a browser
link for the message.

---

## list-accounts

List archived accounts. While the daemon's first message-count refresh is
still running, the table shows `pending` in the messages column, and JSON
entries carry `"counts_pending": true` in place of `message_count` and
`source_deleted_count`. Later calls show the finished counts or a cached
snapshot.

```bash
msgvault list-accounts [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

---

## update-account

Update account settings through the configured remote server or local daemon.
Use `--local` to force the local daemon when a remote is configured.

```bash
msgvault update-account [account] [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--display-name` | Set a display name for the account |
| `--source-id ID` | Update exactly one source by numeric ID; mutually exclusive with the account argument |

The account argument accepts an identifier or a unique display name. Supply
either an account or `--source-id`.

---

## remove-account

Remove an account or source and all its archived data from the selected msgvault archive. Deletes messages, labels, sync state, credentials no longer shared by another source, and attachment files unique to this source. This is irreversible but does not touch the remote provider.

```bash
msgvault remove-account [account] [flags]
msgvault remove-account 123456789012345678 --type discord
msgvault remove-account --source-id 42
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-y`, `--yes` | Skip the confirmation prompt (and allow removal when an active sync is in progress) |
| `--type` | Source type to remove when the same identifier exists across source types (`gmail`, `imap`, `mbox`, `discord`, etc.) |
| `--source-id ID` | Remove exactly one source by numeric ID; mutually exclusive with the account argument and `--type` |

The account argument accepts an identifier or a unique display name.

Attachment files are only deleted when no other account references the same
content hash. A Discord bot token is preserved while another registered guild
uses it, and deleted after its last source is removed. The shared Parquet
analytics cache is rebuilt automatically.

---

## stage-delete

Stage active messages as a pending deletion batch using exactly one selector:
Gmail-like search criteria or a comma-separated list of explicit internal message
IDs. The query form uses the daemon's search and preflight checks before staging;
the ID form sends the existing `message_ids` field directly to the daemon. The
command does not delete messages from a provider.

In query mode, staging is refused while the daemon is still verifying or
rebuilding its full-text search index, or while its analytical cache is unavailable, because an
incomplete index could silently omit matching messages. Both states resolve in
the background; retry when they finish. These search-index and analytical-cache
requirements apply to query mode.

In query mode, like deletion staging in the TUI and Web UI, the selection is
resolved against the committed analytical snapshot, so messages synced after the most recent
cache build are not included until the daemon refreshes the cache (it does so
automatically after each sync). Re-run the command after a refresh to stage
newly synced matches.

```bash
msgvault stage-delete <query>
msgvault stage-delete --ids 123,456,789
```

Exactly one of `<query>` and `--ids IDS` is required. The selectors are mutually
exclusive, and `--ids` is also mutually exclusive with `--source-id`.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | Show the staged subset and skipped counts without creating a deletion batch |
| `--source-id ID` | Restrict staging to one exact source ID |
| `--ids IDS` | Stage positive, unique, comma-separated internal message IDs instead of a query |

Query staging requires daemon API schema 2.18.0 or newer so the preflight
reports the exact deletable subset. Upgrade the daemon if the CLI rejects its
schema version.

The query resolves with the same search semantics as `msgvault search`, and
`--dry-run` prints the set that staging would create.

Deletion staging covers email from Gmail and Microsoft Graph mail (`msmail`)
sources only. A search that also matches chats, meetings, calendar entries, or
mail from other sources such as IMAP or Apple Mail imports stages the
deletable subset and reports how many items it skipped. Only
a search with nothing deletable in it is refused. Legacy Gmail messages imported
before message types existed carry a blank type and count as email, so
`message_type:email` stages them too.

In ID mode, the
daemon resolves live targets and source boundaries for the requested IDs;
IDs that do not resolve to live deletable messages with provider message
IDs are omitted, so the
reported count is the number of targets resolved by the daemon; the CLI does
not search, probe FTS readiness, call Explore or preflight, or require
analytical-cache readiness. A newly started local daemon may initialize its
cache in the background for later query consumers.

For a query that resolves to one source, the source selector is optional. For a
multi-source query, provide `--source-id` for each source:

```bash
msgvault stage-delete --source-id 42 "from:newsletter@example.com older_than:1y"
```

Review a created batch with `msgvault show-deletion <batch-id>`, then execute it
with `msgvault delete-staged <batch-id>`.

---

## list-deletions

List pending and recent deletion batches.

```bash
msgvault list-deletions
```

---

## show-deletion

Show details of a deletion batch.

```bash
msgvault show-deletion <batch-id>
```

---

## cancel-deletion

Cancel pending or in-progress deletion batches. When called without a batch ID, lists available batches.

```bash
msgvault cancel-deletion [batch-id]
msgvault cancel-deletion --all
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--all` | Cancel all pending and in-progress batches |

---

## delete-staged

Execute staged remote deletions. Gmail and IMAP move messages to Trash by
default, and Microsoft Graph mail moves them to Deleted Items. `--permanent`
uses Gmail batch deletion, IMAP UID EXPUNGE, or Graph `permanentDelete`; the
IMAP permanent path requires UIDPLUS. The first deletion for a Graph mail
account asks to upgrade its token to `Mail.ReadWrite`. Recovery from Trash depends on the
provider. See [deletion behavior](usage/deletion.md).

```bash
msgvault delete-staged [batch-id] [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-y`, `--yes` | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `--permanent` | Permanently delete through Gmail batch deletion, IMAP UID EXPUNGE, or Graph `permanentDelete` instead of moving to Trash |
| `--headless` | Use device-code sign-in for Microsoft Graph permission upgrades; open the printed URL on another device |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be deleted without deleting |
| `-l`, `--list` | List staged deletion batches |
| `--account` | Filter to one source by identifier or unique display name |
| `--source-id ID` | Filter to exactly one source by numeric ID; mutually exclusive with `--account` |

Starting in v0.20.0, remote deletion remains permanently opt-in. The invoking
CLI may enable it durably with `[deletion] remote_enabled = true` or for one
command with `MSGVAULT_ENABLE_REMOTE_DELETE=1`. Both mechanisms are permanent;
there is no planned automatic removal of the guardrail. A remote daemon's own
`[deletion]` section is not server policy for a command invoked elsewhere.
Staging, `--list`, and `--dry-run` remain ungated. `--permanent` and `--yes`
are mutually exclusive because permanent deletion always requires the
destructive confirmation prompt.

---

## repair-identity

Confirm a source's own email address and recompute `is_from_me` for matching
archived messages. This writes immediately; it has no dry-run flag. Sources
whose account address is already confirmed are skipped.

```bash
msgvault repair-identity user@example.com
msgvault repair-identity --type imap
```

The optional identifier narrows the repair. `--type` selects a source type and
defaults to `gmail`. Only plain, valid email addresses are confirmed. For
reviewing other aliases, use [identity discovery](#identity).

## repair-senders

Recover missing sender metadata from archived email MIME. The default is a
read-only report; `--apply` writes repairs and refreshes analytics. This repairs
messages that have neither `sender_id` nor a From-recipient snapshot and does
not replace existing sender evidence or contact a provider.

```bash
msgvault repair-senders
msgvault repair-senders --apply
```

## repair-message

Repair one Gmail message snapshot, or audit stored Gmail MIME without changing
it. The repair form can fetch the message from Gmail; the audit is local.

```bash
msgvault repair-message --audit
msgvault repair-message --audit --source-id 42 --json
msgvault repair-message 123 --source-id 42
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--audit` | Inspect stored MIME; accepts no message argument |
| `--source-id` | Limit to one positive source ID |
| `--json` | Emit newline-delimited audit results; requires `--audit` |

Without `--audit`, supply exactly one internal numeric message ID or Gmail ID.
Repair fetches a fresh Gmail snapshot and replaces that message's stored MIME,
headers, bodies, recipients, labels, and MIME attachment rows. It preserves the
internal message ID and provider-owned attachments.

The audit parses stored raw MIME and compares it with the archived fields on
every run. It does not contact Gmail, change the archive, or read saved mismatch
flags. Coherent messages are omitted. After a successful repair, run the same
audit again to confirm the message is omitted; no re-sync or cache rebuild is
needed. When stored part keys are available, attachments are compared by
physical MIME occurrence, so separate parts with identical bytes still count
separately. Older rows without part keys cannot prove how many times identical
content occurred.

An `inconclusive` raw MIME result means the stored MIME is missing, cannot be
decoded or parsed, or exceeds the audit's 64 MiB decompression limit. Repair
fetches fresh MIME from Gmail and requires it to parse successfully. If fetching,
parsing, publishing attachment bytes, or replacing the snapshot fails, the stored
snapshot stays unchanged. A later cache-refresh error can occur after the
snapshot has been committed; re-audit to check that snapshot. If a message
remains flagged after a successful repair, retain the new audit result and the
repair's error output for diagnosis.

## repair-derived

Recompute derived text and metadata from retained provider payloads without
contacting the provider. The command writes immediately and refreshes analytics;
it leaves raw payloads, downloaded media, and sync cursors in place.

```bash
msgvault repair-derived
msgvault repair-derived --source-type beeper
```

Repeat `--source-type` or `--identifier` to narrow the source set. A requested
type that has no re-derivation pass and no source in the archive is an error.
Source types with a re-derivation pass (`beeper`, `discord`) recompute their
derived text and metadata. Every source also derives account attribution for
email and calendar rows still pending it, so `received:` and `account:` find
them. Source syncs and imports run the same work first, so use this command
for on-demand repair, file imports you will not run again, or retrying an
interrupted pass.

## gc

Permanently purge **all source-deleted messages** from a SQLite archive,
compact the database, and remove loose attachment blobs no remaining message
references. Active messages and messages hidden only by deduplication remain.
This does not contact providers and does not run on PostgreSQL.

```bash
msgvault gc
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--yes`, `-y` | `false` | Skip interactive confirmation |
| `--no-backup` | `false` | Skip the automatic SQLite database backup |

There is no source/date selector or dry-run flag. The automatic backup covers
the database, not attachment bytes removed afterward. Create a complete
[backup](usage/backup.md) first. After a purge, follow the printed instructions
to rebuild each enabled analytics or embedding cache. See
[local purge](usage/deletion.md) for the difference from remote deletion.

## purge-excluded-media

Remove locally stored provider media excluded by the current media policy,
replacing its occurrences with typed skip markers. Messages remain. Shared
blobs stay live while a retained occurrence references them; packed dead bytes
are reclaimed by the daemon's normal repack maintenance.

```bash
msgvault purge-excluded-media --dry-run
msgvault purge-excluded-media
```

`--dry-run` previews occurrence, blob, and logical-byte counts without changing
the archive. Applying requires confirmation or `--yes` (`-y`). This never
removes media from a provider. Review [media policy](configuration.md#media-policy)
and [backup](usage/backup.md) before applying.

---

## repair-encoding

Fix UTF-8 encoding issues in existing messages through the configured remote
server or local daemon. The command streams the daemon's stdout/stderr back to
the terminal, and the daemon serializes the repair with other archive mutations.
For SQLite archives, it also rebuilds the analytics cache.
It reports invalid RFC 822 Message-ID values and leaves their original bytes
unchanged to avoid making distinct identifiers collide. The analytics cache
exports these IDs as NULL. Recover the original values separately from a
verified source before rebuilding the cache.

It does not repair source message IDs, source identifiers, recorded
sender/recipient envelope addresses, account identity addresses, or participant
identifiers. Those fields need separate recovery from verified original
values; rebuilding the analytics cache alone
cannot recover them.

```bash
msgvault repair-encoding
```

---

## repair-dates

Report email messages whose canonical `sent_at` is missing, before 1990, or
more than 30 days in the future. The command resolves replacements from a
plausible `Date` header, the oldest plausible `Received` timestamp, or stored
source metadata, in that order.

The default is a read-only report. Pass `--apply` to update the archive and
write a JSON audit ledger under the data directory. SQLite archives also
rebuild the Parquet analytics cache; PostgreSQL archives do not use that cache.
Original source files and remote servers are never modified.

```bash
msgvault repair-dates
msgvault repair-dates --apply
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--apply` | Write repaired dates to the archive |

---

## update

Update msgvault to the latest version.

```bash
msgvault update [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--check` | Check for updates without installing |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `-f`, `--force` | Force update even if already on the latest version |

---

## version

Print version, commit, build date, and platform information.

```bash
msgvault version
```

---

## completion

Generate a shell completion script.

```bash
msgvault completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell]
```

To load completions:

**Bash:**
```bash
source <(msgvault completion bash)

# Permanent (Linux):
msgvault completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/msgvault

# Permanent (macOS with Homebrew):
msgvault completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/msgvault
```

**Zsh:**
```bash
msgvault completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_msgvault"
```

If shell completion is not already enabled, add `autoload -U compinit; compinit` to your `~/.zshrc` first.

**Fish:**
```bash
msgvault completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/msgvault.fish
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
msgvault completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

---

## logs

View and tail structured log files from the selected daemon. With `[remote].url` configured, this shows remote daemon logs; otherwise it starts or contacts the local daemon. File logging must be enabled first (see [Configuration: Log](/docs/configuration/#log)).

```bash
msgvault logs [flags]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `-f`, `--follow` | `false` | Follow today's log file as new lines are written |
| `-n`, `--lines` | `50` | Number of trailing lines to show before following |
| `--run-id <id>` | — | Filter to a single run (matches on prefix) |
| `--level <level>` | — | Filter by log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `--grep <string>` | — | Substring filter applied to the raw JSON record |
| `--all` | `false` | Read every log file in the logs directory, not just today's |
| `--path` | `false` | Print the selected daemon's log directory path and exit |

Examples:

```bash
# Last 50 lines of today's log
msgvault logs

# Follow live
msgvault logs -n 200 -f

# Filter to a single run by its correlation ID
msgvault logs --run-id a1b2c3

# Only errors
msgvault logs --level error

# Substring search across all log files
msgvault logs --all --grep deduplicate
```

---

## quickstart

Print a quickstart guide for AI agents.

```bash
msgvault quickstart
```

---

## agent-token

Manage restricted agent grants. The daemon must be started with `[server] agent_access = true`
and a non-empty `[server] api_key`. All three subcommands require owner authentication
(the owner API key; keyless loopback is not sufficient); a delegated caller cannot issue or modify grants.

The daemon keeps grants in memory; restarting it invalidates their tokens.

### What a token does and does not defend against

A restricted agent token scopes and revokes access for an agent process. It is not a
boundary against an agent that holds shell access as the daemon owner: such an agent can
read provider credentials, rewrite `config.toml`, or replace the daemon binary. What
tokens buy is scoping and revocability for an agent already constrained by its deployment
environment, plus a usable way to run the daemon somewhere the agent cannot reach.

A token does not defend against a local agent process running under the same user account
as the daemon. The supported model keeps owner credentials, provider credentials, daemon
configuration, and daemon replacement outside the agent's authority — a remote
user-managed daemon achieves that, and so does an isolated local agent environment, while
a second daemon or data directory under the same unrestricted user does not.

A grant is valid until it is revoked, reaches its optional expiry, or the daemon
restarts. Revocation blocks subsequent authentication; requests already
authenticated may complete.

### Scoped archive reads

Use a scoped grant for an agent that needs archive reads. Keep the owner key on
the daemon host for administration. The owner key retains unrestricted access.

```bash
msgvault agent-token issue --label researcher \
  --permissions search.read,message.read --source-ids 1,2 --expires 24h
msgvault --agent-url https://archive.example.test \
  --agent-token-file ./reader.token search 'subject:meeting' --json
msgvault --agent-url https://archive.example.test \
  --agent-token-file ./reader.token show-message 42 --json
```

| Permission | Granted reads |
|---|---|
| `search.read` | Keyword search with snippets and body-match excerpts, metadata lists, fast search, aggregate counts, and domain search |
| `message.read` | Message bodies and metadata, and containing threads |
| `attachment.read` | Attachment metadata and stored bytes; message access alone does not grant bytes |
| `stats.read` | Statistics within the granted sources; global database size is omitted |

Unscoped reads select the grant's live sources. Explicit accounts, collections,
and source sets must fit entirely inside that grant. Collection membership is
resolved for every request; adding an ungranted source makes that collection
unavailable to the grant. CLI search and stats return `400 empty_scope` for an explicitly empty collection. Other supported reads return no matches, and discovery hides empty collections. Source matching
uses source type and identifier, so removing and re-adding the same source
preserves authority. A request without the needed permission, or one that
selects accounts outside the grant, returns 403 `permission_denied` and names the
required permission. A message, thread, or attachment outside the grant returns
the same 404 as one that does not exist.

`--agent-url` and `--agent-token-file` also support `stats` and an `mcp`
stdio server without local owner configuration. Supported MCP tools include
keyword search, message and thread reads, attachment reads, lists, aggregate,
and stats. Multi-source metadata lists, fast search, aggregates, and stats keep
exact per-call scopes. Deep body search requires a single source. Pass `account` when the grant covers
several accounts. Read grants and expiry require API schema 3.9.0 or newer; vector and
hybrid reads remain unavailable to scoped grants.

Agent searches start a background index check and clear the status once the index is complete. An incomplete index prompts the owner to run `rebuild-fts` or search once to repair it. Read grants can check the index and cannot rebuild it. With `--json`, the CLI keeps its result array and prints index advice on stderr; Admitted HTTP search, aggregate, filter and total-statistics responses with search text, and MCP keyword search responses, include `index_state`.

Scoped archive reads return a consistent authorized view. Scoped aggregates read live SQL tables and may take longer on large archives. Unknown or ungranted account and collection selectors return 403 `permission_denied`. A check started by an agent that exceeds two minutes reports `unverified` to agents until the owner searches, runs `rebuild-fts`, or the daemon restarts. Owner searches check without that limit and repair automatically. An owner check that fails also reports `unverified`; the next owner search checks again. Each MCP attachment chunk is authorized again, including cached continuations.

The delegated MCP catalog lists a read tool only when the grant holds its permission. Draft and calendar tools are listed for every grant. The daemon checks each call against the token, and a denial names the permission the call needs.

Sync, deletion, configuration, account and token administration, SQL, exports,
people administration, and all other ungranted routes are rejected. Existing
`draft.*` and `calendar.*` permissions retain their separate authority.

### agent-token issue

Issue a new restricted grant for one agent. The secret is printed once and not stored by
the daemon (only its SHA-256 digest is kept in memory). Write it to a file that the agent
can read, never pass it as a flag or environment variable.

```bash
msgvault agent-token issue --label <name> \
  --permissions draft.create \
  --source-ids <id>[,<id>...] \
  --sender <source-id>=<address>
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--label <name>` | (required) Human-readable name for the grant |
| `--permissions <perms>` | Comma-separated permissions: `search.read`, `message.read`, `attachment.read`, `stats.read` (see [scoped archive reads](#scoped-archive-reads)); `calendar.read` for availability, `calendar.event.read` for provider-derived event details in delegated plans and write receipts, `calendar.write` for calendar mutations, and additional `calendar.invite` for guest changes; `draft.create` for `draft-reply`, `draft-compose`, and `draft-get`; `draft.edit` for `draft-get`, `draft-edit`, and `draft-recover`; `draft.delete` for `draft-get`, `draft-delete`, and `draft-recover` (see [managed drafts](#draft-get-draft-edit-draft-delete-and-draft-recover)) |
| `--source-ids <ids>` | Comma-separated source IDs that the permissions apply to |
| `--expires <expiry>` | Optional future RFC3339 timestamp or positive duration such as `24h`; the CLI clock converts a duration to absolute expiry |
| `--sender <source-id>=<address>` | Restrict a source to one confirmed sender identity; repeat for multiple choices |

The grant is valid until it is revoked, reaches its optional expiry, or the daemon
restarts.

When `--sender` is omitted for a selected source, issuance snapshots every
currently confirmed valid mailbox identity. Sender selections are stored as
canonical mailbox keys and remain fixed until the token is revoked. Adding an
alias later does not expand an existing grant. A source with no selected sender
has no delegated draft sender authority. Calendar grants use exact calendar source
identities and do not require a draft sender selection. Delegated callers can run
`calendar` commands and `mcp` over stdio; the delegated MCP bridge combines scoped read, draft, and calendar tools.

The response includes the daemon address, the secret, and the granted source references.
Pass `--agent-url <address>` and the file path to `--agent-token-file` when invoking delegated commands.
Delegated commands include `msgvault mcp`, which offers the admitted draft tools over stdio using that grant.
The address comes from the issuing request. On a default local install it is an
HTTP loopback URL, which works only on that machine and requires
`--agent-allow-insecure`. For an agent on another machine, use a reachable HTTPS
address instead. Plain HTTP requires `--agent-allow-insecure` and sends the token
without transport encryption; use it only on a trusted network.

### agent-token list

List all grants, including expired ones. Secrets and digests are never returned.
Agent-token commands return an error when `server.agent_access` is disabled.

```bash
msgvault agent-token list
```

Each row shows the grant ID, label, permissions, sources (as
`id/type/identifier`), frozen sender keys, creation time, and optional expiry.
Expired grants remain listed with an `(expired)` marker so the owner can revoke
them. Expired grants cannot authenticate.

### agent-token revoke

Revoke a grant by ID. Returns `204` whether or not the ID existed, so grant IDs cannot be
enumerated by probing revoke.

```bash
msgvault agent-token revoke <id>
```

The grant is removed from the in-memory registry immediately. Any request in flight that
already passed authentication completes, but the next authentication attempt with the
revoked secret is denied without fallback.
