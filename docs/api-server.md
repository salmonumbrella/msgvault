title: Web UI & API Server
description: Daemon-served analytical Web UI and REST API for your msgvault archive, with optional background sync scheduling.
---


## Overview

`msgvault serve` starts an HTTP server that exposes your archive through the
first-party Web UI at `/` and a REST API under `/api`. It optionally runs a
background sync scheduler to keep accounts up to date on a cron-based schedule.
The complete UI is embedded in the release binary; see [Web UI](/docs/web-ui/) for
browser login, secure remote deployment, search states, and keyboard controls.

### Choose an integration path

| Need | Start here |
|---|---|
| Browse the archive | [Web UI](web-ui.md) |
| Use a generated Go client | `pkg/client` in the repository |
| Build a client in another language | `/openapi.json` from the daemon or `msgvault openapi` |
| Submit a background backfill | [Historical import jobs](#historical-import-jobs) |
| Follow background work | `/api/v1/operations/runs` and `/api/v1/operations/status` |
| Integrate an AI assistant | [MCP server](usage/chat.md) |

### API compatibility

The API publishes its generated OpenAPI contract at `/openapi.json`.
`msgvault openapi` prints the checked-in contract without starting a daemon or
opening an archive. OpenAPI `info.version` is the **API schema version**;
it is separate from the binary release version. The current schema is **2.30.0**.
Upgrade clients and daemon together across incompatible schema versions,
including remote deployments.

Schema 2.30.0 adds Kata availability and person agenda reads, creation, linking,
list placement, and unlinking. See [Kata configuration](configuration.md#integrationskata)
for setup and limits.

Schema 2.29.0 adds `took_ms` and a required `timings` breakdown
(`query_embedding_ms`, `retrieval_ms`, and `hydration_ms`) to vector and hybrid
`/api/v1/search` responses. SQLite responses also include an `accelerator`
field identifying the retrieval path.

Schema 2.27.0 adds deterministic meeting context export, archived action-item
listing, and duration metrics with exact direct or Explore scope.

Schema 2.28.0 adds optional `text_enabled` and `visual_enabled` fields to
authenticated health responses. They report configured search lanes; request
handlers still check readiness when each search runs.

Schema 2.26.0 adds optional `web_url` metadata to message result schemas. The
URL opens that message in the selected daemon's browser interface.

Schema 2.25.0 adds the CardDAV publication review flow:
`GET /api/v1/carddav/publications/{person_id}/preview` returns the exact
vCard the next write would send plus an approval token, and
`POST /api/v1/carddav/publications/{person_id}/approve` approves it. For a
conflict preview, follow approval with explicit `keep_local` conflict resolution;
other previews publish on approval.
Publication responses gain `inference_review_required`; see the
[CardDAV guide](usage/people-carddav.md#review-inferred-changes-before-they-are-exported).

Schema 2.24.0 adds Google Contacts authorization and CardDAV provider selection.

Schema 2.23.0 describes Settings structure. A sectioned group lists its
`sections`, and each setting in such a group names its `section`; groups
without sections omit both. A secret's state gains an optional `hint`: the
first three and last three characters of the value joined by an ellipsis
(`sk-…x9Q`), so a client can show which key is set. It is omitted for a
value under twelve characters, for the CardDAV password, and when nothing
is set; the value itself is never returned. `validation` gains two optional
fields:

- `format: "cron"` marks a five-field cron schedule (minute, hour, day of
  month, month, day of week) as the daemon's scheduler parses it: `*` or `?`,
  numbers, ranges, comma lists, `/step`, and three-letter month and weekday
  names. A `CRON_TZ=<zone>` or `TZ=<zone>` prefix with an IANA zone name runs
  the schedule in that zone instead of the daemon's local time. Descriptors
  such as `@hourly`, the `L`, `W`, and `#` extensions, and a field made only
  of commas are rejected. The daemon trims surrounding whitespace and treats
  a zone prefix with no fields after it as the empty value, then validates
  the expression on PATCH; an empty value is rejected when the setting is
  `required`.
- `off` names the value that switches a setting off (`value`), what happens
  while it is off (`label`), a starting value for switching it on (`suggest`),
  and `on_minimum`, the smallest value accepted while on. A value between the
  off value and `on_minimum` is raised to `on_minimum` on PATCH rather than
  rejected. `minimum` and `maximum` keep covering every accepted value
  including the off value, so a client that ignores `off` still accepts what
  the daemon stores.

The daemon no longer emits the `sync`, `logging`, `activity`, and `backup`
groups, which folded into `sources`, `server`, and `archive`; the `group` enum
keeps them so clients still accept older daemons.

Schema 2.21.0 adds Saved View execution at
`POST /api/v1/saved-views/{id}/run`, publishes the accepted Saved View
definition values, and includes incompatibility reasons when reading stored
views. Explore file responses also declare when semantic search uses only
active messages.

Participant analytics live under `/api/v1/participants/*`; durable curated
profiles live under `/api/v1/people/*`. CardDAV publication and conflict
responses are bounded projections that omit raw vCards and resource hrefs;
only the explicit publication preview route returns a raw vCard.
See [release changes](changelog.md#upgrade-and-compatibility) for removed paths
and the 1.x/2.x transition.

### Archive and processing boundaries

The API uses the same archive database and attachment store as other clients.
SQLite is the default; PostgreSQL has [documented feature limits](architecture/postgresql.md).
Keyword search and ordinary reads use stored data. Semantic and hybrid search
also call the configured embedding endpoint. Profile, document, and enrichment
operations have their own provider and consent contracts.

Operation history includes durable worker runs, date filters, filter-bound
pagination, error codes, and supported actions. `GET
/api/v1/documents/status/current` reports the selected document extraction
profile without requiring its identifier. The OpenAPI document defines exact
request and response fields.

Go integrations can use the generated client in `pkg/client`. The wrapper
handles msgvault-specific response details such as deletion staging dry-runs
returning `200` while created manifests return `201`.

### Startup and readiness

The HTTP listener, health endpoint, and API routing start before analytics cache
maintenance. With `engine = "auto"`, aggregate requests initially use live SQL
while the cache is built or opened, then switch to DuckDB after success. If no
usable cache can be opened, the daemon stays on live SQL. A failed automatic
refresh keeps the last usable publication. With
`engine = "duckdb"`, analytics remain unavailable until the required cache is
ready, so analytics routes return `503` during initialization; the daemon does
not fall back to SQL. Cache-dependent routes also return a structured `503`
while automatic cache maintenance is active. Its `readiness` field lets clients
distinguish transient `building` state from an unavailable cache and retry
without requiring user action. Set `auto_build_cache = false` to skip automatic
startup maintenance.

## Quick Start

Add a `[server]` section to your `config.toml`:

```toml
[server]
api_port = 8080
api_key = "your-secret-key"
```

Start the server:

```bash
msgvault serve
```

Test connectivity:

```bash
# Health check (no auth required)
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Archive stats (auth required)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/stats

# Generated OpenAPI document
curl http://localhost:8080/openapi.json
```

## Authentication

Archive API endpoints require authentication when `api_key` is set in your
config. The public application shell, `/health`, and the browser-session
bootstrap/login routes remain reachable so the UI can determine whether login
is required. Three API-key authentication methods are supported:

| Method | Header | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Bearer token | `Authorization: Bearer <key>` | `Authorization: Bearer my-secret` |
| API key header | `X-API-Key: <key>` | `X-API-Key: my-secret` |
| Plain auth header | `Authorization: <key>` | `Authorization: my-secret` |

If no `api_key` is configured, authentication is not required regardless of bind address. The separate `allow_insecure` / security validation prevents starting without an API key on non-loopback addresses.

## Historical import jobs {#historical-import-jobs}

Start a Gmail or IMAP history backfill and poll its progress without keeping an
HTTP request open. These endpoints use the daemon's existing account
credentials and full-sync path. They do not accept uploaded archive files.
See [the importing guide](/docs/usage/importing/#historical-import-jobs) for a
step-by-step example.

### Start an import {#post-apiv1imports}

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/imports`

Send one JSON object with `Content-Type: application/json`. The request body is
limited to 16 KiB; unknown fields and additional JSON values are rejected.

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `account` | Yes | Exact account identifier or display name, matched case-insensitively, for one Gmail or IMAP source |
| `after` | No | Lower date bound in `YYYY-MM-DD` form |
| `before` | No | Upper date bound in `YYYY-MM-DD` form; must be later than `after` when both are present |
| `limit` | No | Non-negative message limit; `0` or omission means unlimited |
| `query` | No | Gmail search expression; a nonempty value is rejected for IMAP |
| `noresume` | No | Set `true` to start fresh instead of using a resumable checkpoint; defaults to `false` |

A successful request returns **`202 Accepted`** with a durable `job_id` and the
status record described below. It starts background work immediately; it does
not create a persistent queue that will automatically resume after a restart.

| Error | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `404 not_found` | No matching account exists |
| `409 ambiguous_account` | More than one syncable source matches the account name |
| `409 sync_already_active` | The source already has an active sync or import |
| `422 account_not_syncable` | The matching source is not Gmail or IMAP |
| `422 validation_failed` | A required value, date range, limit, or provider-specific field is invalid |
| `413 request_too_large` | The body exceeds 16 KiB |
| `415 unsupported_media_type` | The request is not JSON |
| `503 service_unavailable` | The daemon cannot start historical imports, including during shutdown |

Malformed JSON and unknown fields return `400 bad_request`. Normal API
authentication and archive-operation locking also apply.

### Read progress {#get-apiv1importsjobid}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/imports/{job_id}`

Returns **`200 OK`** for an existing job or **`404 not_found`** for an unknown
ID. The start and progress responses have the same shape:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `job_id` | Durable ID to save and poll |
| `account` | Resolved source identifier |
| `status` | `pending`, `running`, `done`, or `failed` |
| `processed`, `added`, `skipped` | Counts across sync runs belonging to this job |
| `created_at` | UTC creation time |
| `started_at` | UTC start time, or `null` before work starts |
| `finished_at` | UTC completion time, or `null` while unfinished |
| `summary` | Present for `done`; contains `processed`, `added`, `updated`, `skipped`, and `errors` |
| `error` | Present for `failed`; currently the generic message `import failed` |

`skipped` is the non-negative remainder of processed messages after additions
and updates. Check `summary.errors` as well as the terminal status when
assessing coverage. Detailed failure information belongs to daemon logs and
sync-run diagnostics; it is not returned in the job's generic `error` field.

### Disconnects, failures, and restarts

Closing the client connection does not cancel a submitted job. Daemon shutdown
cancels running import work. On the next start, the daemon marks jobs abandoned
in `pending` or `running` state as `failed`; it preserves their IDs and progress
for later inspection.

Messages already committed remain archived after a failure. Submit a new job
with the same account and bounds to continue through the normal resumable
importer. Leave `noresume` false when you want to reuse available progress.
There is no dedicated cancellation endpoint for these jobs.

## API Endpoints

### Curated person network {#get-apiv1peopleidnetwork}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/people/{id}/network`

Returns a read-only, person-centred projection built only from durable typed
relationships and employments. It never derives nodes or edges from messages,
conversations, participant co-occurrence, or the analytical cache.

`depth` defaults to `1` and accepts `1`, `2`, or `3`. `include_ended` defaults
to `false`; set it to `true` to admit ended relationships and employment
records. The deterministic breadth-first response contains at most 250 nodes
and 500 edges. `truncated: true` means the response is a bounded prefix and can
contain fewer than either maximum. The root durable person is returned even
when it has no qualifying connections.

```json
{
  "root_person_id": 42,
  "depth": 2,
  "truncated": false,
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "person:42", "kind": "person", "entity_id": 42, "label": "Example Person", "hop": 0},
    {"id": "organization:21", "kind": "organization", "entity_id": 21, "label": "Example Organization", "hop": 1}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"id": "employment:7", "kind": "employment", "source_node_id": "person:42", "target_node_id": "organization:21", "label": "Engineer"}
  ]
}
```

Invalid depths return `400`; an unknown durable person returns `404`. The
projection has no ETag because it is not a mutation resource.

---

### Person brief enrollment {#get-apiv1peopleidbrief-enrollment}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/people/{id}/brief-enrollment`

Read whether a durable person is enrolled in the "last time we talked" brief.
Enrollment enables brief generation for that person when eligible messages
and provider budget are available.

```json
{"person_id": 7, "enrolled": true, "enabled_at": "2026-08-14T09:12:03Z", "actor": "api"}
```

`enrolled` is `false` with a `null` `enabled_at` and an empty `actor` when the
person has no enrollment row. An unknown durable person returns `404` /
`person_profile_not_found`.

---

### Replace person brief enrollment {#put-apiv1peopleidbrief-enrollment}

**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/v1/people/{id}/brief-enrollment`

**Request:**

```json
{"enrolled": true, "track": true}
```

`enrolled` is required. Enrollment requires a tracking row: `track: true` adds
one in the same transaction, and without it an untracked person is refused with
`409` / `person_brief_not_tracked`. `track` is ignored when `enrolled` is
`false`. The response is the same shape as the read above.

---

### Current person brief {#get-apiv1peopleidbrief}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/people/{id}/brief`

Return the person's current brief version. A person with no stored version
returns `404` / `person_brief_not_found`.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "status": "current",
  "generated_at": "2026-08-29T18:44:02Z",
  "rendered_text": "Last time you talked (Aug 29, chat): they were preparing for a role change. They said they were learning to cook on weekends. You may want to ask how the transition went.",
  "renderer_policy": "person-brief-render-v1",
  "sentences": [
    {"kind": "last_interaction", "index": 0, "text": "Last time you talked (Aug 29, chat): they were preparing for a role change.", "evidence_ordinals": [0]},
    {"kind": "highlight", "index": 0, "text": "They said they were learning to cook on weekends.", "evidence_ordinals": [0]},
    {"kind": "follow_up", "index": 0, "text": "You may want to ask how the transition went.", "evidence_ordinals": [0]}
  ],
  "structured": {
    "last_meaningful_interaction": {"evidence_id": "evidence:...", "summary": "they were preparing for a role change"},
    "highlights": [
      {"text": "they were learning to cook on weekends", "speaker": "person", "evidence_ids": ["evidence:..."], "observed_at": "2026-08-29", "confidence_basis_points": 700}
    ],
    "follow_ups": [
      {"question": "how the transition went", "why": "the change was still pending", "highlight_index": 0, "evidence_ids": ["evidence:..."]}
    ],
    "appreciations": [],
    "uncertainties": [],
    "possible_attributes": []
  },
  "evidence": [
    {
      "ordinal": 0,
      "evidence_id": 4411,
      "evidence_key": "9c2f...",
      "source_ref": "person-sweep/v1:...",
      "source_url": "",
      "directness": "direct-self",
      "event_time": "2026-08-29T18:41:55Z",
      "evidence_supported": true
    }
  ],
  "boundary": {
    "lanes": ["conversation_text"],
    "from_event_time": "2026-07-01T00:00:00Z",
    "through_event_time": "2026-08-29T18:41:55Z",
    "through_sequence": 184233,
    "item_count": 31,
    "input_bytes": 48211,
    "packet_sha256": "..."
  },
  "dropped_item_count": 1,
  "program_id": "msgvault-person-brief",
  "program_version": "v1",
  "provider": "glm",
  "model": "glm-5.3",
  "rejected_at": null,
  "rejected_reason": "",
  "superseded_at": null
}
```

`structured` is the validated record; `rendered_text` is derived from it.
`sentences` maps each rendered sentence back to the structured item it came
from; it is rebuilt on read and is empty for a version stored under a renderer
policy this build does not know, which `renderer_policy` names. Each sentence's
`evidence_ordinals` are the `ordinal` values in this response's `evidence` array
that the sentence itself cites, so a client can expand one sentence to its own
citations. The list is empty when the citation order behind the version cannot
be accounted for exactly, and a client falls back to the whole `evidence` array
rather than attributing a citation it is not sure of. `evidence` cites the
archive items the brief as a whole used, with `evidence_supported: false` once a
later status event invalidated an item's source. `dropped_item_count` counts
structured items msgvault refused. Responses are `Cache-Control: no-store`. The
brief never contains an excerpt of the archive text it was derived from.

---

### Person brief version history {#get-apiv1peopleidbriefversions}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/people/{id}/brief/versions`

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `limit` | integer | `20` | Versions to return, 1 to 200. Out-of-range values return `400` / `invalid_limit` |

Newest-first history under a `versions` array, each entry shaped exactly like
the current-brief response. Versions are immutable: a regeneration inserts the
next version as `current` and marks the previous one `superseded`.

---

### Reject a person brief {#post-apiv1peopleidbriefreject}

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/people/{id}/brief/reject`

**Request:**

```json
{"reason": "merges two different threads"}
```

Marks the current version `rejected` and returns it in the same shape as the
current-brief response, with `rejected_at` and `rejected_reason` set. `reason`
is optional. The version stays readable in history, and the next eligible run
produces a replacement without waiting out `min_interval`. A person with no
current version returns `404` / `person_brief_not_found`, and so does
`GET /api/v1/people/{id}/brief` after a rejection, until a replacement version
is generated.

---

### Generate a person brief {#post-apiv1peopleidbriefgenerate}

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/people/{id}/brief/generate`

Runs one forced sweep attempt for that person and waits for it. The request has
no body.

```json
{"run_id": "9d1c...", "attempt_id": "5f20...", "brief_version": 3, "brief_failure_class": ""}
```

`brief_version` is the version the attempt stored, or `0` when it stored none;
`brief_failure_class` identifies a brief-generation failure when the overall
attempt succeeded. It can also be empty with version `0`: no eligible evidence
is a successful attempt that produces no brief. For example, an email-only
person has no supported brief evidence.
The forced run bypasses the minimum interval and the new-activity check but
still requires enrollment, a consented provider profile with
`allow_sensitive = true`, and available budget. It spends provider budget for
every call it makes, and on a person whose cursors are already caught up it may
also run one bounded extraction page.

Generation reports these conditions before running:

| Status | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `409` | `person_brief_not_enrolled` | Enroll the person first |
| `409` | `person_brief_lane_disabled` | `[people.sweep.brief] enabled` is `false` |
| `409` | `person_brief_policy_refused` | The provider profile does not allow sensitive content |
| `409` | `person_brief_no_supported_lane` | The provider profile does not allow `conversation_text` |
| `409` | `person_brief_busy` | Another worker holds the person's sweep lease; retry after it finishes |
| `503` | `brief_generation_unavailable` | The daemon started without the people sweep worker, for example with `[people.sweep] enabled = false` |

Briefs use only supported chat and text-message sources within
`conversation_text`; email, meeting transcripts, documents, and owner-authored
messages are excluded. A scheduled sweep skips brief generation when the
profile does not permit its sources or sensitive content.

Restart the daemon after enabling sweeps or changing the selected provider.
Manual brief generation uses the configuration loaded at daemon startup.

---

### Health check {#get-health}

**Endpoint:** `GET /health`

Health check endpoint. Does not require authentication.

**Response:**

```json
{"status": "ok", "analytics_engine": "sql-fallback"}
```

`analytics_engine` reports the active mode: `sql-fallback` while `engine =
"auto"` is waiting for or cannot use a cache, `duckdb` after a successful cache
build/open, `sql` for deliberate live SQL, `postgres` for PostgreSQL, and
`initializing` while required DuckDB analytics are being prepared. Health stays
available during initialization; analytics routes return `503` until the
required engine is ready.

Authenticated `GET /api/v1/health` also includes `api_schema_version`. Starting
with schema 2.28.0, its `vector` object can include `text_enabled` and
`visual_enabled`. These fields reflect configured lanes and remain true while a
lane initializes or fails. Public and delegated health responses omit them.

---

### Archive statistics {#get-apiv1stats}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/stats`

Archive statistics. When vector search is configured on the server,
the response also includes a `vector_search` sub-object describing
the state of the index.

Stats answer within about 2 seconds while a sync or cache build loads the
archive:

- If fresh counts are not ready by then, the response reuses the previous
  counts and sets `"stale": true`, with `as_of` giving when they were
  computed. The fresh counts replace them when they finish.
- Vector statistics get 3 seconds. After that, the response sets
  `"vector_stats_unavailable": true` instead of failing.

`GET /api/v1/cli/accounts` bounds its message counts the same way, reporting
`stale` and `as_of` at the top level.

**Response (vector search disabled):**

```json
{
  "total_messages": 142857,
  "total_threads": 48293,
  "total_accounts": 2,
  "total_labels": 47,
  "total_attachments": 31204,
  "database_size_bytes": 8589934592
}
```

**Response (vector search enabled):**

```json
{
  "total_messages": 142857,
  "total_threads": 48293,
  "total_accounts": 2,
  "total_labels": 47,
  "total_attachments": 31204,
  "database_size_bytes": 8589934592,
  "vector_search": {
    "enabled": true,
    "active_generation": {
      "id": 3,
      "model": "nomic-embed-text-v1.5",
      "dimension": 768,
      "fingerprint": "nomic-embed-text-v1.5:768:p1-111111:c32768:e1",
      "state": "active",
      "activated_at": "2026-04-18T15:12:33Z",
      "message_count": 142820
    },
    "building_generation": {
      "id": 4,
      "model": "nomic-embed-text-v2",
      "dimension": 768,
      "started_at": "2026-04-19T09:02:10Z",
      "progress": { "done": 8200, "total": 142857 }
    },
    "missing_embeddings_total": 134657
  }
}
```

`active_generation` is always present in the object (null until the
first build completes). `building_generation` is omitted when no
rebuild is in flight. `missing_embeddings_total` reports live messages
still needing embedding for the generation the worker will target next:
the building generation while a rebuild is in flight, otherwise the active
generation. During a rebuild the old active generation keeps serving vector
and hybrid search, but active-generation top-ups are frozen until the
building generation activates. See
[Vector Search](/docs/usage/vector-search/) for the end-to-end workflow.

---

### List messages {#get-apiv1messages}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/messages`

Paginated message list.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `page` | int | `1` | Page number |
| `page_size` | int | `20` | Results per page |

**Response:**

```json
{
  "total": 142857,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 20,
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": 12345,
      "subject": "Q4 Planning",
      "message_type": "email",
      "from": "alice@example.com",
      "to": ["bob@example.com"],
      "cc": ["carol@example.com"],
      "sent_at": "2024-10-15T09:30:00Z",
      "snippet": "Here's the draft for Q4...",
      "labels": ["INBOX", "IMPORTANT"],
      "has_attachments": true,
      "size_bytes": 52480
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Filter messages {#get-apiv1messagesfilter}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/messages/filter`

List messages with structured filters backed by the query engine. This is the
API equivalent of drilling into aggregate/search results and is the endpoint to
use for message-type filtering when you do not need full-text ranking.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sender` / `sender_name` | string | — | Sender address/phone or display-name filter |
| `recipient` / `recipient_name` | string | — | Recipient address/phone or display-name filter |
| `domain` | string | — | Participant domain filter |
| `label` | string | — | Label filter |
| `message_type` | string | — | Stored message type, for example `email`, `teams`, `discord`, `calendar_event`, or `sms` |
| `source_id` | int | — | Restrict to one source |
| `conversation_id` | int | — | Restrict to one conversation/thread |
| `after` / `before` | date | — | RFC3339 or `YYYY-MM-DD` bounds |

The companion `GET /api/v1/messages/gmail-ids` endpoint returns matching Gmail
source message IDs for email workflows such as deletion staging. It honors a
subset of these parameters: `sender` / `sender_name`, `recipient` /
`recipient_name`, `domain`, `label`, `source_id`, `after` / `before`, and
`limit`. Results are always restricted to Gmail sources, exclude deleted
messages, and are ordered newest-first; the remaining `/messages/filter`
parameters (`message_type`, `conversation_id`, `attachments_only`,
`hide_deleted`, `offset`, `sort`, `direction`) are ignored.

### Changed messages {#get-apiv1messageschanges}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/messages/changes`

Lists messages whose content changed at or after a cursor, oldest change first.
Poll it, re-read the rows it returns, and store the cursor it hands back. Unlike
`/messages/filter` it is ordered by when a message *changed*, not by when it was
sent, so a mailbox imported today with ten-year-old mail shows up in the very
next page.

**What it is.** An invalidation feed over one projection of a message: the
columns this endpoint returns, plus a body edit and two columns it does not
return. It tells you *that* a message changed and hands you the current value of
those columns. It does not tell you how many times it changed, what it held in
between, or that anything outside that projection changed.

**What it is not.** It is not a way to keep a general copy of the archive
current. Labels, recipients, attachment metadata and content, raw MIME, body
deletions, participant edits, and conversation metadata are all outside it — and
several of those, label re-sync above all, are the most frequent changes a mail
archive sees. Hard deletions are outside it too: a row removed from the database
leaves nothing behind to report.

So build on it a consumer that keeps a projection of the tracked columns fresh,
or one that reacts to messages changing. Do not build on it a mirror that has to
match the archive, unless you also refresh the untracked surfaces on your own
schedule and reconcile deletions independently. The exact boundaries are
[What this feed does not report](#what-this-feed-does-not-report) and the
[delivery contract](#delivery-contract).

Messages hidden by deduplication and messages deleted at the source are
included, with their `deleted_at` and `deleted_from_source_at` timestamps set.
A consumer keeping a copy of the tracked columns needs both to learn that a
message it already holds has been hidden or deleted.

The dedup-hidden ones are what this feed is alone in returning: every other
message listing filters them out with `deleted_at IS NULL`, and no parameter
turns that off. Source-deleted messages are not unique to it —
`/messages/filter` returns those by default too, and `hide_deleted=true` is what
suppresses them there — but this feed returns them unconditionally, with no
parameter that hides them.

The watermark moves for every mutable field the feed returns, for message-body
edits, and for two columns the feed does not return: the sender pointer
(`messages.sender_id`) and the platform metadata payload. It never moves for
anything else — see
[What this feed does not report](#what-this-feed-does-not-report).

Part of what moves it is readable only from `/api/v1/messages/{id}`, so the feed
*does* invalidate some of that response. When a message reaches you through the
feed, re-fetch its detail response if you cache either of these:

* `body` and `body_html`. An added or edited body moves the watermark. A body
  *deletion* does not, so a body you already hold can still go stale — that one
  is in the exception list below.
* `from`. It is derived from the sender pointer, and a change of pointer moves
  the watermark. Renaming or correcting the participant the pointer names does
  not, so the address or display name can still change under you.

The rest of the detail response the feed genuinely never invalidates: `to`,
`cc`, `bcc`, `labels`, and the `attachments` array — filenames, hashes, sizes
and all — can all change without the message ever reappearing in the feed.
Refresh those on your own schedule.

**The cursor is opaque.** Store the `next_cursor` a response hands you and send
it back unchanged; do not parse it, construct one, compare two of them, or order
them. What it encodes is the server's business and may change without notice.
Omit it, or send it empty, to start from the beginning of the archive.

The token is not authenticated. The server holds no secret and does not sign it,
so it cannot tell a cursor it issued from a well-formed one you built yourself —
and it does not try. A fabricated cursor that names this archive is accepted; all
it does is move your own position in your own feed, and it reaches no message you
could not already ask for. What the server *does* refuse, with a
`400 invalid_cursor` rather than a silent restart from the beginning of the
archive, is a token it cannot read at all, one carrying a cursor format this
build does not speak, and one issued against a **different archive**.

That last one is worth planning for. A cursor is a position in one specific
archive — the archive it names, and no other — so a stored cursor keeps working
across a restart, an upgrade, or a file-level restore of the same archive, but is
rejected if you point the daemon at a different `--db` or at an archive rebuilt
from scratch. Surviving a restore is not the same as being correct across one: a
restore that rolls the archive *back* past your cursor loses what it undid, which
the [delivery contract](#delivery-contract) sets out. The rejection is the point: honouring it would resume the walk at
an unrelated position and silently never deliver the records before it. Restart
the sync from the beginning of the archive instead.

}
```

Each row is a complete snapshot, never a patch, so an unset or empty field is
left out of the row entirely rather than sent as `null` or `""`. Read an absent
key as "empty" and overwrite whatever you had cached for it. Always present:
`id`, `source_id`, `conversation_id`, `size_estimate`, `has_attachments`,
`attachment_count`, `content_changed_at`. `messages` is always an array, never
`null`.

`server_time` is the database server's clock at the moment the page was read,
not the client's and not the daemon process's. `has_more` reports whether more
rows are already waiting; when it is `true`, request the next page immediately
instead of waiting for the next poll.

`next_cursor` is where the next request resumes. It is always present and never
empty, so you always have something to send back — on an empty page and at the
very beginning of the archive alike.

`complete_through` is how far the feed is caught up, which is a different
question from what time it is. Every change committed strictly before it, at or
after the cursor you sent, is now *reachable* — in this page, or in a page you
can fetch right now — barring the exceptions the
[delivery contract](#delivery-contract) sets out. It is **not a cursor**: the
only cursor is `next_cursor`, and a consumer that resumes from
`complete_through` while `has_more` is `true` skips every row in between.

`complete_through` is never after `server_time`, and on a healthy server trails
it by microseconds; see [Delivery contract](#delivery-contract) for when it stops
tracking and what that means. A page never reaches it — rows stamped in that same
instant are held back — so the very newest changes arrive on the following poll.

On a server that has only just started, `complete_through` can be `null`. No
bound has been established yet, so the feed is complete through nothing. It
happens when every attempt to read the bound so far has been beaten by a writer,
and it resolves by itself on the first quiet moment.
Such a page carries no rows and echoes your cursor back unchanged, so it is safe
to keep polling; the whole archive from your cursor onward is delivered once the
bound is established.

On an empty page the response normally echoes the cursor you sent. The exception
is a cursor standing *above* the database clock: it matches nothing, and echoing
it would leave you polling a feed that answers "caught up" forever while the
archive changes, so the response moves it down to the start of
`complete_through` instead — the start, so that a row stamped at that very
instant is still ahead of the cursor whatever its message id. It
lands on the commit bound rather than on the clock because a change that is
stamped but not yet committed sits between the two, and a cursor at the clock
would step over it. A server that has not yet established a bound has no
proven-safe point to move to, so there the cursor is echoed unchanged.

You can reach that state through no fault of your own — an NTP correction, a
resumed VM, a restore onto slower hardware. Being moved gets you going again; it
does not undo whatever put you above the clock. If that was a clock stepped
backwards, the changes already stamped below the new position are gone from your
walk — see the [delivery contract](#delivery-contract).

#### Walking the feed

First request — no cursor, so the feed starts at the beginning of the archive:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $MSGVAULT_API_KEY" \
  "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/messages/changes?limit=100"
```

```json
{
  "messages": ["... 100 messages ..."],
  "count": 100,
  "has_more": true,
  "next_cursor": "1.eyJ0IjoiMjAyNi0wNy0yMFQxODowNDoxMS45MDIzMTdaIiwiaSI6NDQ3MSwiYSI6IjNmMGI5YzJlN2Q1MTQ4NmFiMGM0ZTI5ZjdhNjFkODUzNGM5ZTBiMTdkMmE2ZjM4NTE5ZTRjN2IwYTI1ZDYzMTgifQ",
  "server_time": "2026-07-26T10:00:03.114500Z",
  "complete_through": "2026-07-26T10:00:03.114488Z"
}
```

`has_more` is `true`, so send the next request immediately. It comes from a
one-row lookahead: the server asked for one row more than your `limit` and got
it, so a further row was already there to be read. Expect the next page to carry
rows.

Second request — the cursor from the first response, verbatim:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $MSGVAULT_API_KEY" \
  "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/messages/changes?cursor=1.eyJ0IjoiMjAyNi0wNy0yMFQxODowNDoxMS45MDIzMTdaIiwiaSI6NDQ3MSwiYSI6IjNmMGI5YzJlN2Q1MTQ4NmFiMGM0ZTI5ZjdhNjFkODUzNGM5ZTBiMTdkMmE2ZjM4NTE5ZTRjN2IwYTI1ZDYzMTgifQ&limit=100"
```

```json
{
  "messages": ["... 12 messages ..."],
  "count": 12,
  "has_more": false,
  "next_cursor": "1.eyJ0IjoiMjAyNi0wNy0yNFQwOToxMjo1Ny40MTgwMDRaIiwiaSI6NTEwOSwiYSI6IjNmMGI5YzJlN2Q1MTQ4NmFiMGM0ZTI5ZjdhNjFkODUzNGM5ZTBiMTdkMmE2ZjM4NTE5ZTRjN2IwYTI1ZDYzMTgifQ",
  "server_time": "2026-07-26T10:00:04.550118Z",
  "complete_through": "2026-07-26T10:00:04.550102Z"
}
```

Third request — `has_more` was `false`, so this one waits for your poll interval.
Nothing changed in between, so the page is empty and the cursor comes back
unchanged:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $MSGVAULT_API_KEY" \
  "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/messages/changes?cursor=1.eyJ0IjoiMjAyNi0wNy0yNFQwOToxMjo1Ny40MTgwMDRaIiwiaSI6NTEwOSwiYSI6IjNmMGI5YzJlN2Q1MTQ4NmFiMGM0ZTI5ZjdhNjFkODUzNGM5ZTBiMTdkMmE2ZjM4NTE5ZTRjN2IwYTI1ZDYzMTgifQ&limit=100"
```

```json
{
  "messages": [],
  "count": 0,
  "has_more": false,
  "next_cursor": "1.eyJ0IjoiMjAyNi0wNy0yNFQwOToxMjo1Ny40MTgwMDRaIiwiaSI6NTEwOSwiYSI6IjNmMGI5YzJlN2Q1MTQ4NmFiMGM0ZTI5ZjdhNjFkODUzNGM5ZTBiMTdkMmE2ZjM4NTE5ZTRjN2IwYTI1ZDYzMTgifQ",
  "server_time": "2026-07-26T10:00:34.771205Z",
  "complete_through": "2026-07-26T10:00:34.771190Z"
}
```

The loop is: re-read the rows, take `next_cursor` from the response, send it as
the next request, and repeat — immediately while `has_more` is `true`, on your
poll interval when it is not. An empty page echoes the cursor you sent, so a
caught-up consumer can send the response straight back forever without
re-reading the archive.

A page that reports `has_more: true` and is then followed by an empty one is not
the ordinary case: the lookahead row existed when the first page was read, so
something has to have happened to it since. Either it was hard-deleted, or its
watermark moved — forward to at or above the next page's
[commit bound](#delivery-contract), which holds it back until the bound catches
up, or backward below the cursor you are holding, which is the clock-step case
in the delivery contract. Only the backward step loses a change you would
otherwise have been handed — a hard deletion was never reportable at all — and
none of the three is a reason to stop polling.

#### Delivery contract {#delivery-contract}

**What the feed guarantees.** After a change to a tracked column, written the
ordinary way — through the application, with the watermark left to the database
triggers — the message is delivered by following `next_cursor`, in as many
further pages as `has_more` calls for, however long its writing transaction took.
The row you get carries the message's current values as of the moment the page
was read.

**What kind of feed that makes it.** Latest-state invalidation, not an event
stream. The archive holds one mutable watermark per message and keeps no change
history, so what a page delivers is "this message is stale, re-read it" — never
how many times it changed or what it held in between. Two consequences follow,
and neither is a defect to be worked around:

* Several changes to one message between two of your polls arrive as **one** row,
  carrying the last of them. The intermediate states are gone from the archive,
  so no cursor and no re-read can recover them.
* The same change can arrive **more than once** — resuming from an earlier cursor
  re-delivers rather than erroring or skipping — and nothing distinguishes a
  re-delivery from a fresh change.

So a consumer must be able to re-read a message it already holds, and must not
count feed rows as changes or drive anything off their number.

**Every exception to that guarantee is in "What is still best-effort" below.**
That list is the complete one and the only place that enumerates them; every
other passage in this document and in the source points here instead of
restating it.

`complete_through` is what makes the guarantee hold: the page stops below the
oldest write that could still commit, not below the clock, so — for every write
the bound can see — the cursor cannot come to rest above a change that has been
stamped but not yet published. The guarantee is about the cursor, not about any
single response: keep following `next_cursor` and nothing outside the exception
list is lost; substitute `complete_through` for it and the rows between it and
`next_cursor` are lost as well.

**What it costs.** The feed cannot advance past the start of any open transaction
that holds — or is queued for — a write lock on the message table. A batch
import, a source-deletion run, or a client that wrote a message and then sat on
its `BEGIN` freezes `complete_through` for as long as that lasts. Only
transactions bearing on the message table count, and only for as long as they
last: a long read, an idle connection, a batch writing some other table, and
autovacuum's routine work do not hold the feed back, whichever database role
they belong to.

On PostgreSQL the test is the lock, not the write, and that is deliberate. A
transaction still *waiting* to acquire a write lock on `messages` — behind
someone else's `ALTER TABLE`, say — counts from the moment it queues, before it
has written anything, and it holds the bound back to its own transaction start
rather than to the moment it began waiting. Waiting to write is the state that
immediately precedes writing, and the bound has to be below a write before it
happens rather than after; counting a transaction that turns out never to write
costs a visible gap, while missing one that does costs a silently skipped row.

On SQLite, where there is no way to ask which transaction is open, any write
transaction held longer than a moment has the same effect.

During the freeze the feed keeps serving: a consumer with a backlog goes on
draining every row committed below the frozen bound, page after page, exactly as
it would otherwise. What the freeze costs is the far end of the walk — once your
cursor reaches the bound, the feed returns no rows and `has_more: false`, which
reads exactly like being caught up. The difference is that `complete_through` has
stopped tracking `server_time` while `server_time` keeps moving. **That gap is
the signal.** If it grows past a few seconds, something is holding a write
transaction open. Once it passes a minute the server logs a warning
(`message change feed is not advancing`, with the lag and a cause), repeated at
most once a minute while the condition lasts. A normal batch write causes a gap
for as long as the batch runs and then closes it; that is the mechanism working,
not a fault.

There is one case with no gap to measure and no minute to wait for: a server
that has never established a bound at all, because a write transaction was open
on every attempt since it started. `complete_through` is `null` then, so there
is no lag to report, and the same warning is logged on the very first request,
under the same once-a-minute throttle — carrying `lag: "unknown"`,
`complete_through: "none"`, and its own cause. Read it as "this server has never
seen the message table quiescent", which on a freshly started daemon usually
means an import was already running when it came up.

Read the gap as "how stale the bound is", not as "how long that transaction has
been open" — the two are the same number only on PostgreSQL, where the bound is
the open transaction's own start time. SQLite has no way to ask when another
connection's transaction began; its bound is the last moment the server caught
the database with the write lock free, so the gap measures the age of that
observation instead. A writer is genuinely in flight whenever the gap is open,
but on SQLite it may have started seconds ago and still show a gap of hours,
because time in which nothing polled the endpoint is time in which no reading was
taken. On SQLite the gap is an upper bound on the writer's age; on PostgreSQL it
is a measurement of it.

**What is still best-effort.** This list is the canonical one: every exception to
the guarantee above is here, and no other passage in this document or in the
source enumerates them. The feed does not promise that a change reaches a
consumer once and only once, it does not promise that a change reaches one
promptly, and there are surfaces it cannot see at all:

* Rows may be delivered more than once. Resuming from an earlier cursor
  re-delivers rather than erroring or skipping.
* Changes to one message coalesce. Several changes between two of your polls
  arrive as a single row carrying the last of them, because the archive holds one
  mutable watermark per message and no change history. Nothing on the wire says
  how many changes a row stands for, and the intermediate states are not stored,
  so no cursor recovers them. A consumer that must observe every individual
  change cannot get that here.
* Hard deletions are never reported. A row removed from the database outright
  leaves nothing behind for the feed to report.
* Changes to anything outside the tracked columns are not reported — see
  [What this feed does not report](#what-this-feed-does-not-report).
* **PostgreSQL only:** PostgreSQL hides other roles' connections from a role that
  is neither a superuser nor a member of `pg_read_all_stats`, and a writer the
  server cannot see cannot hold the bound back. Rather than quietly resume losing
  rows, the feed stops advancing while a hidden connection is *writing to the
  message table*: `complete_through` freezes at the last reading taken while every
  such writer was visible. So this shows up as a stalled feed, not as missing
  changes. A hidden connection that is idle, reading, or writing something else
  changes nothing. msgvault uses one role, so this arises only if something else
  writes the same message table; if it does and the feed stalls, grant the
  msgvault role `pg_read_all_stats`. Where there is nothing to fall back to — a
  server that started while a hidden writer was already inside its transaction —
  the endpoint returns `500` rather than a page and the server log names the
  grant. It clears by itself when that transaction ends.
* **PostgreSQL only:** a *prepared* transaction (two-phase commit) holds its locks
  without an owning session, so the feed cannot see when it began, and one that
  wrote to the message table and then committed could publish its change behind a
  cursor that had already moved past it. It needs `max_prepared_transactions > 0`,
  which is off by default, and msgvault never uses two-phase commit. If another
  application runs prepared transactions against the same database, reconcile
  independently rather than relying on the feed.
* **A stamp at or above the current bound waits for the bound to reach it.** The
  feed orders by the watermark stored on the row, not by the instant the write
  committed, and a page stops strictly below `complete_through`. So a row stamped
  at or above the bound is not returned, and while it is the only thing
  outstanding the feed reports `has_more: false` — which reads exactly like being
  caught up. **That is a delay, not a loss:** no cursor this page hands you gets
  past the waiting stamp, so the row arrives on the first page read after the
  bound clears it. (The moved cursor an empty page can hand you stands exactly
  *on* the bound; that is still safe, because it names the *start* of that
  instant rather than a position after some row in it, so every row stamped
  there is still ahead of it whatever its message id.) A watermark
  written by hand for a future instant waits until that instant genuinely arrives;
  a server with no bound yet is this case at its limit, selecting nothing until
  the first bound reading. A clock stepped backwards leaves you holding a cursor
  above the clock too and looks identical, but what it strands is stamped *below*
  your cursor, where no bound will ever bring it back — that is the next bullet,
  and it is a loss rather than a wait. On SQLite the column can also hold a value
  no bound will ever reach, and there the wait never ends and the change really is
  lost; that is case 2 below.
* **A database clock that steps backwards loses the changes committed below your
  cursor while it climbs back.** The feed orders by the wall-clock watermark
  stored on the row and your cursor only ever moves forward, so both rely on the
  database's clock being monotonic. When it is not — an NTP step, a resumed or
  migrated VM, a restore onto a host whose clock is behind — the writes that
  follow the step are stamped in clock time your walk has already passed, and
  every one of them stamped below the cursor you hold fails the keyset comparison
  on that poll and on every poll after it. Both backends stamp from the database
  server's own wall clock, so both are affected. **This is a loss, not a delay** —
  the row is not waiting for anything, and nothing on the wire distinguishes it
  from a healthy feed. It is bounded by the size of the step: what is lost is the
  changes committed during the stretch of clock time the step re-runs, and normal
  delivery resumes once the clock passes your cursor again. Moving a cursor that
  stands above the clock narrows the window but cannot close it, and does not
  happen at all for a consumer that polls late enough for the clock to have
  climbed back above its cursor. The cursor being opaque changes none of this. No
  cursor the server can hand you reaches back below itself; a full re-read from an
  empty cursor does, because these rows are perfectly selectable — see the
  reconciliation note at the end of this list.
* **Restoring the archive from an older snapshot loses everything the rollback
  undid.** A cursor names the archive that issued it, and a file-level restore of
  the same archive keeps that name — deliberately, because a restore of the same
  archive is exactly the case a stored cursor is meant to survive. But a cursor
  issued *after* the snapshot was taken still validates against the restored
  database, and everything the rollback undid now sits below it: a row reverted to
  an older watermark fails the keyset comparison on that poll and on every poll
  after it, and a row the rollback removed produces no event at all. Your mirror
  goes on holding content the archive no longer has. **This is a loss, not a
  delay**, and nothing on the wire distinguishes it from a healthy feed — the same
  shape as the backward clock step above, and the same underlying cause: the walk
  is ordered by a wall-clock watermark with no monotonic sequence behind it.
  Copying the archive **file** — `cp`, a filesystem snapshot, a backup restored
  under a different path — forks it the same way and keeps the original's
  identity, so a cursor from either copy is accepted by the other even as the two
  drift apart. A subset built with `msgvault create-subset` does not: it is a new
  database with an identity of its own, so a cursor issued against the original
  is rejected there with `400 invalid_cursor`, and a consumer of the subset
  starts from an empty cursor. The repair is a full
  re-read from an empty cursor: it restores the tracked fields of every row the
  restored archive still has, though a row the rollback removed is
  indistinguishable from a hard deletion — see the reconciliation note at the end
  of this list. **After restoring an archive from a snapshot, restart your
  consumers from an empty cursor.**
* **A `NULL` watermark is invisible to the feed, on either backend.** The page
  compares `content_changed_at` against both of its bounds and a `NULL` satisfies
  neither, so the row is not returned from any cursor. No write path produces one
  — every writer stamps the column and the first-run backfill fills in a database
  that predates it — so this takes direct SQL, and whatever content change the
  same statement made goes unreported with it. The next ordinary change to one of
  the row's tracked columns stamps a fresh watermark and the row rejoins the feed
  carrying its current content. If no such change ever comes, it stays invisible.
* **SQLite only:** direct SQL can store a `NULL` or malformed
  `content_changed_at`; normal write paths do not. The feed returns an error for
  a `NULL` watermark or a malformed value selected by the page instead of
  inventing a timestamp and moving the cursor. SQLite orders non-date values by
  their raw type and text, so a corrupt value outside the requested range can
  still be unreachable. Repair the stored watermark directly before resuming.
* A consumer that must not diverge from the archive should still reconcile
  periodically — for example, a scheduled full re-read from an empty cursor. It
  re-delivers every row the feed can select, so it restores the tracked fields of a
  malformed row that remains selectable and a row stranded by a backward clock
  step. What it does not do: it cannot reach a malformed watermark that sorts
  outside the feed range, and it recovers nothing outside the tracked columns.
  Nor does it identify a hard
  deletion: a row your mirror has and the walk never returns is simply a row no
  cursor can reach, which is what a hard deletion and an out-of-range corrupt
  watermark both look like from outside. Separating them takes the same direct read
  — a row absent from a direct `SELECT` over `messages` was hard-deleted, and one
  still there has a watermark the feed cannot reach.

Re-reading an overlapping window is safe, so a consumer that wants extra margin
can keep an older `next_cursor` of its own and resume from that instead, trading
duplicates for margin. Build that margin out of a cursor the feed handed you,
never out of `complete_through`.

#### What this feed does not report {#what-this-feed-does-not-report}

The watermark is maintained by triggers on the `messages` table and on message
bodies. The trigger on `messages` covers every column the feed returns, plus the
sender pointer and the platform metadata payload, which it does not return.
Everything else a message has — including the remaining columns of `messages` —
is outside it:

| Surface | Where it lives | Does changing it move the message into the feed? |
|---|---|---|
| Labels | `message_labels` | No — and label re-sync is the most frequent change in a mail archive |
| Recipients (to/cc/bcc) | `message_recipients` | No |
| Attachment metadata (filenames, hashes, sizes, storage paths) | `attachments` | No — but `has_attachments` and `attachment_count` are message columns, so an attachment set that changes those does appear |
| Raw MIME | `message_raw` | No — including raw MIME added after the message row |
| Read state and platform flags (`is_read`, `read_at`, `is_edited`, `archived_at`) | `messages` | No |
| Threading and identity pointers (`reply_to_message_id`, `rfc822_message_id`) | `messages` | No |
| Conversation metadata (thread title) | `conversations` | No |
| Message body | `message_bodies` | Yes for an added or edited body (see the deletion row below), but the feed reports only `snippet`; fetch the body from `/api/v1/messages/{id}` |
| Message body deletion | `message_bodies` | No — the body triggers fire on INSERT and UPDATE only. Adding or editing a body moves the watermark; deleting one does not |
| Sender *pointer* (`messages.sender_id`) | `messages` | Yes — but the feed does not return it, and only the pointer is tracked. Renaming or correcting the participant it points at changes `participants`, not `sender_id`, so it does **not** move the watermark |
| Platform metadata payload (`metadata`) | `messages` | Yes — but no endpoint returns it, so the wake-up is all you get. It is tracked so that a metadata change still invalidates your cached copy of the fields that *are* returned |

A consumer that caches any of the untracked surfaces has to refresh them on its
own schedule; nothing in this feed will invalidate them.

#### Errors

| Status | `error` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid_cursor`, `invalid_limit` | A parameter is present but could not be used. A cursor this API cannot use — damaged in transit, left over from an incompatible server version, or issued against a different archive — is rejected rather than read as the beginning of the archive; the message says which of those it was, and in each case the only repair is to restart the sync from the beginning. A hand-built cursor is *not* rejected on those grounds alone: the token is unauthenticated, so a well-formed one naming this archive is honoured (see [the cursor is opaque](#get-apiv1messageschanges)). An *empty* value (`?cursor=`) is read as absent, exactly like omitting the parameter, so `?cursor=&limit=10` starts from the beginning of the archive |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | No API key, or one this server rejects. Every request to this endpoint is authenticated the same way the rest of the API is (see [Authentication](#authentication)) |
| 429 | `rate_limit_exceeded` | The caller has outrun the [rate limit](#rate-limiting); `Retry-After` says how long to wait. Worth handling here more than anywhere else, because polling is what this endpoint is for. Polling faster does not make the feed advance sooner — `complete_through` moves with the database, not with your poll rate — and on SQLite it costs the importer write throughput |
| 500 | `internal_error` | The watermark query failed. **PostgreSQL only:** this is also how the no-visibility-floor case above surfaces — a server that has never once read the bound while every writer of the message table was visible has no safe bound to report, so the endpoint refuses rather than returning a page that would step your cursor over an invisible writer's change. The server log names the `pg_read_all_stats` grant that fixes it; it also clears by itself when the foreign transaction ends |
| 503 | `feature_unavailable`, `query_timeout` | `feature_unavailable`: the configured store cannot answer the watermark query, or cannot say which archive it is, so it cannot issue a cursor you could safely resume from. `query_timeout`: the request outran the server's per-request time limit. Both are retryable from the same cursor. (A request the caller abandoned is answered `query_canceled` on the same status, which by definition nobody is left to read.) |

### Message details {#get-apiv1messagesid}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/messages/{id}`

Full message details including body and attachment metadata.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 12345,
  "subject": "Q4 Planning",
  "message_type": "email",
  "from": "alice@example.com",
  "to": ["bob@example.com"],
  "cc": ["carol@example.com"],
  "bcc": ["dave@example.com"],
  "sent_at": "2024-10-15T09:30:00Z",
  "snippet": "Here's the draft for Q4...",
  "labels": ["INBOX", "IMPORTANT"],
  "has_attachments": true,
  "size_bytes": 52480,
  "body": "<plain text body, or HTML when no plain text body exists>",
  "body_html": "<html><body><p>Full HTML body</p></body></html>",
  "attachments": [
    {
      "id": 987,
      "filename": "q4-plan.pdf",
      "mime_type": "application/pdf",
      "size_bytes": 204800,
      "content_hash": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `cc`, `bcc`, and `body_html` fields are included only when present. `body` is the plain-text body when one exists; for HTML-only messages, it falls back to the HTML body so callers still receive message content.

---

### Attachment metadata {#get-apiv1attachmentsid}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/attachments/{id}`

Returns metadata for the numeric attachment ID exposed by message details.
The response includes the SHA-256 `content_hash` used by the content endpoint:

```json
{
  "id": 987,
  "filename": "q4-plan.pdf",
  "mime_type": "application/pdf",
  "size_bytes": 204800,
  "content_hash": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"
}
```

---

### Attachment content by hash {#get-apiv1attachmentshashcontent}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/attachments/{hash}/content`

Streams the raw bytes of an archived attachment from either loose or packed
storage. `{hash}` must be the 64-character SHA-256 `content_hash` returned by
message details or the attachment metadata endpoint.

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $MSGVAULT_API_KEY" \
  --output attachment.bin \
  "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/attachments/$HASH/content"
```

Successful responses set the archived MIME type as `Content-Type` (falling
back to `application/octet-stream`), the archived filename in
`Content-Disposition`, `Content-Length`, and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.
An invalid hash returns `400`; a hash with no attachment row, or content that
is no longer available, returns `404`. The generated Go client's
`GetAttachmentContent` wrapper verifies the returned bytes against the
requested hash before returning them.

---

### Inline image content {#get-apiv1messagesidinlinecidcontent-id}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/messages/{id}/inline?cid=<content-id>`

Fetch an inline MIME image part by content ID. This is intended for rendering `cid:` images referenced by `body_html`.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cid` | string | (required) | MIME `Content-ID` to fetch |

Only inline image parts are served. SVG images and non-image inline parts are rejected with `415 unsupported_type`. If the query engine cannot fetch raw MIME, the endpoint returns `501 not_supported`.

Successful responses set:

| Header | Description |
|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | Inline image content type |
| `Content-Disposition` | `inline` |
| `Cache-Control` | `private, max-age=31536000, immutable` |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` |

---

### Search messages {#get-apiv1search}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/search`

Search messages. The default mode is full-text search (FTS5 with
LIKE fallback). When the server is configured for vector search,
`mode=vector` runs semantic-only search and `mode=hybrid` fuses BM25
and vector ranking via Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

`mode=vector` and `mode=hybrid` both require at least one free-text
term in `q` — the free text is what gets embedded as the query
vector. Operator-only queries such as `q=from:alice` have nothing to
embed and return `400 missing_free_text`; route filter-only requests
to `mode=fts` instead.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `q` | string | (required) | Search query |
| `mode` | enum | `fts` | `fts`, `vector`, or `hybrid` |
| `page` | int | `1` | Page number (FTS only — vector/hybrid reject `page>1`) |
| `page_size` | int | `20` | Results per page (max 100 for FTS, max `[vector].search.max_page_size_hybrid` for vector/hybrid) |
| `message_type` | string | — | Message-type filter; repeat or comma-separate for multiple values |
| `account` | string | — | Restrict to one account/source |
| `collection` | string | — | Restrict to one collection |
| `explain` | 0/1 | `0` | When `1` and `mode=vector|hybrid`, include per-signal scores |

`message_type` uses the same values as local search: `email`,
`calendar_event`, `meeting_transcript`, `beeper`, `teams`, `discord`, `sms`,
`mms`, `whatsapp`, `imessage`, `fbmessenger`, `synctech_sms_call`,
`google_voice_text`, `google_voice_call`, and `google_voice_voicemail`. The
query string can also carry `message_type:` / `message_type=` operators inside
`q`.

**Response (mode=fts, default):**

```json
{
  "query": "quarterly report",
  "total": 23,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 20,
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": 12345,
      "subject": "Q4 Planning",
      "message_type": "email",
      "from": "alice@example.com",
      "to": ["bob@example.com"],
      "cc": ["carol@example.com"],
      "sent_at": "2024-10-15T09:30:00Z",
      "snippet": "Here's the draft for Q4...",
      "labels": ["INBOX", "IMPORTANT"],
      "has_attachments": true,
      "size_bytes": 52480
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response (mode=vector or mode=hybrid):**

```json
{
  "query": "when is the planning offsite",
  "mode": "hybrid",
  "returned": 12,
  "pool_saturated": false,
  "generation": {
      "id": 3,
      "model": "nomic-embed-text-v1.5",
      "dimension": 768,
      "fingerprint": "nomic-embed-text-v1.5:768:p1-111111:c32768:e1",
      "state": "active"
    },
  "took_ms": 84,
  "timings": {"query_embedding_ms": 12, "retrieval_ms": 41, "hydration_ms": 31},
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 12345,
      "subject": "Q2 planning offsite agenda",
      "message_type": "email",
      "from": "alice@example.com",
      "to": ["team@example.com"],
      "sent_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "snippet": "Proposed agenda for the offsite on...",
      "labels": ["INBOX"],
      "has_attachments": false,
      "size_bytes": 2048
    }
  ]
}
```

Vector and hybrid responses expose `returned` instead of `total`
(ANN search does not have a meaningful total count), add a
`generation` sub-object naming the index generation that answered
the query, and include `took_ms` plus a `timings` breakdown
(`query_embedding_ms`, `retrieval_ms`, and `hydration_ms`). The top-level `results` array
replaces `messages`. `pool_saturated` is true when a vector or BM25
candidate pool hit its configured cap (or pure vector search returned
as many hits as requested), hinting that increasing the limit or
narrowing the query may expose more relevant results.

SQLite responses include `accelerator`: `vec1_ivf_opq` for approximate retrieval,
`exact-filter` for an exhaustive search of a small filtered population, `exact`
for exhaustive retrieval, or `exact-fallback` when an accelerator error caused
an exhaustive retry. Accelerator errors are also logged as warnings. Requests
larger than the accelerator's candidate ceiling use exact retrieval.

When `explain=1`, each element of `results` carries an extra `score`
object exposing the fused-score components:

```json
{
  "id": 12345,
  "subject": "...",
  "score": {
    "rrf": 0.032,
    "bm25": 7.4,
    "vector": 0.82,
    "subject_boosted": true
  }
}
```

`bm25` and `vector` are omitted when the message did not appear in
that signal (BM25 missed it or the ANN pool did not include it).
`rrf` is omitted in `mode=vector` (only one signal — there is
nothing to fuse). `subject_boosted` is true when the subject-line
boost was applied.

See [Searching](/docs/usage/searching/) for the full query syntax
reference and [Vector Search](/docs/usage/vector-search/) for vector /
hybrid setup.

### Accounts summary {#get-apiv1accounts}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/accounts`

List configured accounts with sync status.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "email": "you@gmail.com",
      "display_name": "Your Name",
      "last_sync_at": "2024-10-15T08:00:00Z",
      "next_sync_at": "2024-10-15T09:00:00Z",
      "schedule": "0 * * * *",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Source sync status {#get-apiv1sourcesstatus}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/sources/status`

Read sync status for all sources, or filter to one source type with
`source_type`. This endpoint is useful for dashboards and remote
deployments because it exposes active, latest, and last-successful
sync runs without triggering a sync.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `source_type` | string | — | Optional source-type filter, for example `gmail`, `imap`, or `synctech_sms` |

**Response:**

```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "source_type": "gmail",
      "identifier": "you@gmail.com",
      "display_name": "Personal Gmail",
      "last_sync_at": "2026-06-18T13:02:11Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-06-18T13:02:11Z",
      "active_sync": null,
      "latest_sync": {
        "id": 42,
        "source_id": 1,
        "started_at": "2026-06-18T13:00:00Z",
        "completed_at": "2026-06-18T13:02:11Z",
        "status": "completed",
        "messages_processed": 250,
        "messages_added": 12,
        "messages_updated": 3,
        "errors_count": 1,
        "error_message": null,
        "skipped_count": 2,
        "item_errors": [
          {
            "source_message_id": "18fedcba12345678",
            "phase": "ingest",
            "error_kind": "ingest_error",
            "error_message": "parse MIME: malformed header",
            "created_at": "2026-06-18T13:01:44Z"
          }
        ]
      },
      "last_successful_sync": {
        "id": 41,
        "source_id": 1,
        "started_at": "2026-06-18T12:00:00Z",
        "completed_at": "2026-06-18T12:01:18Z",
        "status": "completed",
        "messages_processed": 33,
        "messages_added": 0,
        "messages_updated": 1,
        "errors_count": 0,
        "error_message": null
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`active_sync`, `latest_sync`, and `last_successful_sync` are `null`
when no matching run exists. `item_errors` contains up to the 10 most
recent per-item errors for that run. `skipped_count` counts expected
per-item skips, such as Gmail messages that disappeared between list
and fetch. `error_message` is `null` unless the sync run itself failed
with a run-level error.

### Meeting intelligence {#meeting-intelligence}

These authenticated read operations require daemon API schema 2.27.0 or newer.
They read archived provider evidence without an AI call or upstream mutation.
See the [meeting guide](usage/meetings.md#export-context-and-read-follow-ups)
for the user workflow and coverage meanings.

| Endpoint | Request and result |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/v1/meetings/context` | Exactly one of `message_ids` or an Explore `selection`; returns a context packet envelope |
| `POST /api/v1/meetings/actions` | Optional `scope` or `explore`, plus action filters; returns rows, coverage, count, and cursor |
| `POST /api/v1/meetings/metrics` | Optional `scope` or `explore`; returns totals, duration bases, monthly rows, and undated count |

Context accepts 1–100 meetings, `format: "json"` or `"markdown"`,
`include_transcript` (default false), and `max_bytes` (default 131072, range
4096–1048576). The budget applies to the UTF-8 bytes of `content`, not the HTTP
envelope. Save `content` directly; `content_bytes`, `truncated`, and
`omitted_message_ids` describe that exact download. Mixed selections fail with
`selection_not_all_meetings`.

A direct `scope` supports `message_ids`, `source_ids`, `participant_id` or
`participant_ids`, `person_id`, `domains`, `after`, `before`, and `deletion`.
Person and participant scopes are mutually exclusive. Different filter groups
intersect; values within one group are alternatives. An explicit
`message_ids: []` matches nothing. Omitted scope means all archived meetings.
Dates use RFC3339 timestamps: `after` is inclusive and `before` exclusive.
Deletion defaults to `any`; `active` and `deleted` refer to source deletion.
Locally deleted records never participate.

```json
{
  "scope": {"domains": ["example.com"], "after": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z", "before": "2026-03-01T00:00:00Z"},
  "status": "pending",
  "assignee_email": "alex@example.com",
  "limit": 50
}
```

The actions request above also supports `query` (literal title/description
substring, at most 256 characters) and opaque `cursor`. `limit` defaults to 50
and accepts 1–200. Status accepts `pending`, `completed`, `cancelled`, or
`unknown`; omission includes all. Pagination reads current archived snapshots,
so it is not a retained snapshot across edits. Coverage describes the selected
meetings even when action filters return no rows.

An `explore` scope carries the complete `predicate`, `cache_revision`,
`search_provenance`, and `candidate_snapshot_id` where applicable. It is mutually
exclusive with direct `scope`. The server resolves the full matching population,
with a 10000-ID transfer ceiling. A stale authority requires reloading; an
oversized scope must be narrowed. Neither case widens the request.

### Import a meeting {#post-apiv1importmeeting}

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/import/meeting`

Import one provider-neutral meeting without configuring a provider account.
The authenticated, on-demand endpoint accepts at most 16 MiB of JSON and is
idempotent on `source.identifier` plus `meeting.external_id`: the first import
returns `201` / `created`, and retries return `200` / `updated`.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/import/meeting \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "source": {
      "identifier": "local-meetings",
      "display_name": "Local Meetings",
      "account_email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "meeting": {
      "external_id": "planning-2026-07-29",
      "title": "Planning",
      "started_at": "2026-07-29T09:00:00-04:00",
      "summary_text": "Reviewed the launch plan.",
      "organizer": {"name": "You", "email": "you@example.com"},
      "attendees": [{"name": "Teammate", "email": "teammate@example.com"}]
    }
  }'
```

```json
{
  "status": "created",
  "source_id": 12,
  "message_id": 901,
  "source_message_id": "meeting:planning-2026-07-29"
}
```

Timestamps must be RFC 3339 values with explicit offsets. A meeting must
contain at least one non-empty `summary_markdown`, `summary_text`, `transcript`,
or `transcript_segments` value; plain and segmented transcripts are mutually
exclusive. Segment offsets must be finite, non-negative, and non-decreasing.
`meeting.action_items` accepts up to 1000 structured actions. Each needs a
nonblank title; optional fields preserve explicit assignee, source status, due
date, description, and source ID. An empty array means supported with no actions;
omission means unsupported; `null` is rejected. See the
[complete import example](usage/meetings.md#import-from-any-meeting-source).
Unknown fields are rejected except within `meeting.metadata`.

### OAuth token exchange {#post-apiv1authtokenemail}

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/auth/token/{email}`

Upload an OAuth token JSON file generated by a local `msgvault` client.

This endpoint is used by `msgvault export-token` during remote/headless deployment workflows.

**Request headers:**

- `X-API-Key: <api-key>` (or any supported auth header)
- `Content-Type: application/json`

**Example request body (`/api/v1/auth/token/you@gmail.com`):**

```json
{
  "access_token": "ya29...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "refresh_token": "1//0g...",
  "expiry": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  "scopes": ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify"]
}
```

**Successful response (`201 Created`):**

```json
{
  "status": "created",
  "message": "Token saved for you@gmail.com"
}
```

---

### Create account {#post-apiv1accounts}

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/accounts`

Register or ensure an account is scheduled for sync on the remote server.

`msgvault export-token` posts to this endpoint automatically after uploading a token.

```json
{
  "email": "you@gmail.com",
  "schedule": "0 2 * * *"
}
```

The `enabled` field is always set to `true` server-side.

**If the account already exists (200 OK):**

```json
{
  "status": "exists",
  "message": "Account already configured for you@gmail.com"
}
```

**On success (201 Created):**

```json
{
  "status": "created",
  "message": "Account added for you@gmail.com"
}
```

---

### Start account sync {#post-apiv1syncaccount}

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/sync/{account}`

Trigger a manual sync for an account. Returns immediately with a 202 status while the sync runs in the background.

**Response (202 Accepted):**

```json
{
  "status": "accepted",
  "message": "Sync started for you@gmail.com"
}
```

---

### Scheduler status {#get-apiv1schedulerstatus}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/scheduler/status`

Scheduler state and per-account schedule details.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "running": true,
  "accounts": [
    {
      "email": "you@gmail.com",
      "running": false,
      "last_run": "2024-10-15T08:00:00Z",
      "next_run": "2024-10-15T09:00:00Z",
      "schedule": "0 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

The daemon runs scheduled work one job at a time. While a sync waits for
another job to finish, its entry reports `"queued": true`. While it runs,
`started_at` gives when it began. A schedule tick that fires during a run
sets `"pending": true`, and the scheduler runs the sync once more when the
current run ends. Account syncs (Gmail, IMAP, Teams, and Discord), Slack, and
Beeper support preemption: after holding the gate for a minute while others
are queued, they are asked to stop at their next safe point. If they are
still running five seconds later, the scheduler cancels their context. An
interrupted run goes back behind waiting jobs immediately; it does not wait
for another schedule tick. Maintenance and other jobs without resumable
checkpoints keep their own runtime budgets. Waiting API requests can still
interrupt scheduled work. `GET /api/v1/sources/status` reports the same
state for every scheduled source as `scheduler_queued`, `scheduler_pending`,
and `scheduler_started_at`.

### Preflight an analytical selection {#post-apiv1explorepreflight}

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/explore/preflight`

Validates a revision-pinned selection of canonical archive entries and issues
the single-use `operation_token` required to stage that selection for
deletion. Selections are built from the analytical explore endpoints
(`POST /api/v1/explore` and `POST /api/v1/explore/groups`), whose responses
carry the `cache_revision`, `search_provenance`, and — for semantic/hybrid
search — `candidate_snapshot_id` values a selection must echo back. The full
explore contract is in the generated OpenAPI document (`/openapi.json`).

**Request:**

```json
{
  "selection": {
    "mode": "all_matching",
    "predicate": {
      "filters": [
        { "dimension": "domain", "values": ["example.com"] },
        { "dimension": "before", "values": ["2020-01-01"] }
      ]
    },
    "cache_revision": "<cache_revision from the explore response>",
    "search_provenance": {}
  }
}
```

`selection` fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `mode` | `all_matching` selects everything the predicate matches; `explicit` selects only the listed `row_keys` |
| `predicate` | The explore request being acted on: `filters` (dimensions `source`, `participant`, `domain`, `message_type`, `after`, `before`, `deletion`), plus `query` / `search_mode` for search-backed selections. Cursors are rejected |
| `row_keys` | Explore row keys (the `key` field of explore rows) to include; required when `mode` is `explicit` |
| `exclusions` | Row keys to exclude from an `all_matching` selection |
| `cache_revision` | Required. The `cache_revision` from the explore response being reviewed |
| `search_provenance` | The `search_provenance` from the explore response; checked when the predicate has a `search_mode` |
| `candidate_snapshot_id` | The snapshot ID from the explore response; required for `semantic` / `hybrid` predicates (`400 candidate_snapshot_required` otherwise) |

**Response (200):**

```json
{
  "count": 1234,
  "deletable_count": 1200,
  "estimated_bytes": 52428800,
  "cache_revision": "<current cache revision>",
  "search_provenance": {},
  "unavailable_actions": [
    { "action": "export", "reason": "browser_export_requires_single_message" },
    { "action": "open_in_source", "reason": "trusted_source_link_unavailable" }
  ],
  "action_targets": [],
  "operation_token": "<operation_token>",
  "expires_at": "2026-07-06T15:35:00Z"
}
```

`count` includes all selected items after exclusions. `deletable_count` is the
Gmail subset that can be staged; the difference is the number of items staging
will skip. A chat conversation counts as one item.

`unavailable_actions` lists actions this selection does not support. A
`stage_deletion` entry means nothing in the selection can be deleted from its
source; staging it would fail with `409 selection_not_deletable`. A selection
that mixes deletable and non-deletable items carries no entry: staging takes
the deletable subset and reports the rest as skipped.

The `operation_token` is bound to this exact selection, its match count, and
the current cache revision. It expires at `expires_at` (five minutes after
issue) and is single-use: staging a manifest consumes it, while a staging
attempt that fails before the manifest persists leaves it valid for retry. A
reused or expired token is rejected with `409 operation_token_invalid`.

Malformed selections return `400` with `invalid_selection` (bad `mode`,
missing `cache_revision`, or `mode: "explicit"` without `row_keys`) or
`invalid_selection_predicate`. Malformed search operators return `400 invalid_query`.
If the analytical cache or search index changes
after the explore response was produced, preflight fails with
`409 archive_revision_changed` or `409 search_revision_changed` — re-run
explore and preflight against the new revision. Staging repeats all of these
checks.

### Saved Views {#saved-views}

Saved Views are persistent, shared analytical definitions: a query, an
explicit search mode, filters, a grouping chain, a presentation, a sort, the
visible columns, and the inspector preference. Each record carries a schema
version and a revision. The Web UI, the MCP server, and any API client read,
edit, and run the same records, so a view saved in the browser can be executed
by an agent without rebuilding its query.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/saved-views` | List every Saved View, ordered by name. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/saved-views` | Create a view. Returns `201` with an `ETag` and `Location` header. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/saved-views/{id}` | Read one view. Returns its `ETag`. |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/saved-views/{id}` | Update only the supplied fields. Requires `If-Match`. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/saved-views/{id}` | Delete a view definition. Requires `If-Match`. Never touches archive messages. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/saved-views/{id}/run` | Execute a view through its canonical Explore definition. |

`canonical_state` is a closed version-1 object. The daemon rejects a
definition it could not execute, so every stored view can be opened by the
Web UI and run by the API:

| Field | Accepted values |
|-------|-----------------|
| `query` | Free text. Empty means no text search. |
| `search_mode` | `full_text`, `semantic`, `hybrid`. Defaults to `full_text` when a query is present. |
| `filters[].field` | An Explore filter dimension: `source`, `identity`, `participant`, `domain`, `mailing_list`, `message_type`, `after`, `before`, `deletion`. The legacy aliases `source_id` and `participant_id` are accepted and executed as `source` and `participant`. |
| `filters[].operator` | `eq` or `in`. |
| `filters[].values` | One or more non-empty strings. Numeric identifiers are decimal strings so they survive JavaScript clients unchanged. |
| `grouping` | A drill-down chain of Explore grouping dimensions: `source`, `participant`, `domain`, `message_type`, `mailing_list`, `kind`, `year`, `month`. |
| `presentation` | `table`, `timeline`, or `files`. |
| `sort` | Only `{"field": "occurred_at", "direction": "desc"}`. |
| `columns` | `kind`, `people`, `title`, `excerpt`, `time`, `attachments`, `size`. Presentation only; never sent to Explore. |
| `inspector_pinned` | Optional inspector pin metadata. API and MCP clients preserve explicit `true` and `false` values. The current Web UI keeps the inspector pinned and ignores this field. |

Every field is optional, an explicit `null` is rejected, and unknown or
transient workspace state such as selections and result rows is rejected.
Values are checked with the rules Explore applies when the view runs: `source`
and `participant` take positive integer IDs, `after` and `before` take one
RFC3339 timestamp each and appear at most once, `deletion` takes `active` or
`deleted`, an `identity` filter carries source ID, identifier, and direction
next to a matching single-value `source` filter, and at most one `sort` entry
is allowed. The same vocabulary is published as enums in the OpenAPI document,
so generated clients validate it before a request is sent.

Read responses preserve `canonical_state` as the original JSON, including
definitions from older or unsupported schema versions. Check
`incompatibility_reason` before treating that JSON as an executable definition.
An incompatible view remains readable through the API and MCP so clients can
explain the problem and offer removal.

Mutations use the record revision as an optimistic-concurrency guard. Send
the latest `ETag` (for example `"saved-view-7-r3"`) as `If-Match`; a stale tag
returns `409 saved_view_revision_conflict`, so reload the view and review the
latest revision instead of overwriting it. Other errors are
`400 invalid_saved_view` for a definition outside the vocabulary or an
unsupported schema version, `404 saved_view_not_found`,
`409 saved_view_name_conflict`, `428 if_match_required`, and
`400 invalid_if_match`.

### Run a Saved View {#post-apiv1saved-viewsidrun}

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/saved-views/{id}/run`

Executes the stored definition through the Explore endpoint its definition
selects, with the same validation, search resolution, and cursor pagination
that endpoint applies:

- A view with a `grouping` chain runs `POST /api/v1/explore/groups` at the
  first level of the chain, the level the Web UI shows when it opens the view.
- A view with `presentation: "files"` runs `POST /api/v1/explore/files`.
- Every other view runs `POST /api/v1/explore` as a table. Timeline is a
  client-side rendering of the same entry rows.

```json
{
  "limit": 20,
  "cursor": "eyJvZmZzZXQiOjIwLC..."
}
```

`limit` is `1` to `100` and defaults to `100`. `cursor` is the opaque
`next_cursor` from the previous page and is omitted for the first page. An
empty object `{}` is a valid body.

```json
{
  "saved_view": {
    "id": 7,
    "name": "Invoices",
    "canonical_state": {
      "query": "invoice",
      "search_mode": "full_text",
      "filters": [{"field": "source", "operator": "in", "values": ["1"]}],
      "presentation": "table"
    },
    "schema_version": 1,
    "revision": 3,
    "created_at": "2026-07-19T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-07-19T11:00:00Z"
  },
  "result_kind": "entries",
  "rows": [
    {"key": "message:42", "kind": "email", "title": "Quarterly invoice", "occurred_at": "2026-07-18T11:00:00Z"}
  ],
  "total_count": 2,
  "next_cursor": "eyJvZmZzZXQiOjEsLi4u",
  "cache_revision": "cache-9",
  "search_provenance": {"lexical_index_revision": "fts-4"}
}
```

`result_kind` names the populated array: `entries` carries `rows` in the
`POST /api/v1/explore` row shape, `groups` carries `groups`, and `files`
carries `files`. For semantic and hybrid searches, entry pages omit
`total_count` and report `candidate_snapshot_id` and `candidate_pool_saturated`.
Group and file pages retain Explore's `total_count`: the number of matching
groups or files within the resolved candidate set, not an archive-wide semantic
match count. These pages report `candidate_snapshot_id` and reject an incomplete
candidate pool. `search_deletion_scope` is `active` when a semantic search
narrowed an unrestricted deletion context. `next_cursor` is present while more
results remain.

A missing view returns `404 saved_view_not_found`, and a stored definition the
current daemon cannot execute, such as one written under another schema
version, returns `400 invalid_saved_view`. Every other failure is the Explore
endpoint's own response passed through unchanged: `400 invalid_cursor` or
`invalid_limit`, `409 archive_revision_changed` or `search_revision_changed`
when pagination must restart, `503 vector_not_enabled` or another vector
readiness error for semantic and hybrid views, and the analytical cache
readiness response when the cache is unavailable. Semantic and hybrid views
never fall back to full-text search.

---

### Stage messages for deletion {#post-apiv1deletions}

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/deletions`

Stages messages for deletion by writing a pending deletion manifest. Staging
never touches Gmail — execution remains exclusively the `delete-staged`
command. The endpoint accepts three request shapes:

- **Dry run** — `"dry_run": true` with a `filter` and/or `message_ids`
  resolves and counts without staging anything.
- **Explicit message IDs** — `message_ids` alone (internal IDs as returned by
  `/messages` and `/search`) stages directly.
- **Preflighted selection** — a `selection` plus the `operation_token` issued
  by [`/api/v1/explore/preflight`](#post-apiv1explorepreflight). This is the
  only way to stage a filter-based deletion: a non-dry-run request with a
  `filter` is rejected with `428 preflight_required`.

In every shape, resolution is restricted to live Gmail-source messages, and a
staged manifest executes against a single mailbox: the selection must resolve
to exactly one Gmail source. The durable source tuple (`type` and `identifier`,
plus the local numeric `id`) is stamped on the manifest and reported as
`source` in dry-run and created responses; `delete-staged` resolves that tuple
again before it claims the manifest. The account identifier is also reported;
selections spanning multiple accounts are rejected with
`400 multi_account_selection` — scope the request (for example with
`filter.source_id` or a `source` filter dimension) or stage per account.
Unknown JSON fields are rejected with `400 invalid_request` so a typo'd filter
key cannot silently widen the selection, and requests with no criteria at all
are rejected with `400 empty_filter`, so the entire archive cannot be staged.

#### Dry run

```json
{
  "filter": {
    "sender": "newsletter@example.com",
    "source_id": 1,
    "after": "2019-01-01",
    "before": "2020-01-01"
  },
  "dry_run": true
}
```

Supported `filter` fields: `sender`, `sender_name`, `recipient`,
`recipient_name`, `domain`, `label` (strings), `source_id` (integer), and
`after` / `before` (RFC3339 or `YYYY-MM-DD` dates). The filter can be combined
with `message_ids`; matches are unioned and deduplicated. The server resolves
the request and returns `200` without writing anything:

```json
{
  "dry_run": true,
  "message_count": 1234,
  "account": "you@gmail.com",
  "source": {"id": 1, "type": "gmail", "identifier": "you@gmail.com"},
  "sample_gmail_ids": ["18c2f5a1b2c3d4e5", "..."]
}
```

#### Staging explicit message IDs

A non-dry-run request whose only criterion is `message_ids` stages directly —
the IDs are already an explicit, reviewed list:

```json
{
  "message_ids": [123, 456],
  "description": "old newsletters"
}
```

IDs that do not resolve to live deletable Gmail messages with provider message
IDs are omitted, and the
response `message_count` reports the number of targets resolved by the daemon.

A pending manifest is written and `201` returned:

```json
{
  "dry_run": false,
  "message_count": 2,
  "account": "you@gmail.com",
  "source": {"id": 1, "type": "gmail", "identifier": "you@gmail.com"},
  "id": "20260706-153000-old-newsletters-a1b2",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

#### Staging a preflighted selection

Filter-based staging goes through preflight so the reviewed selection — not a
re-evaluated filter — is what gets staged:

1. `POST /api/v1/explore` with the predicate; review the rows and note
   `cache_revision` (plus `search_provenance` and `candidate_snapshot_id` for
   search-backed predicates).
2. `POST /api/v1/explore/preflight` with the `selection`; review `count`, `deletable_count`, and
   `estimated_bytes`, and keep the `operation_token`.
3. `POST /api/v1/deletions` with the same `selection` and the token:

```json
{
  "selection": {
    "mode": "all_matching",
    "predicate": {
      "filters": [
        { "dimension": "domain", "values": ["example.com"] },
        { "dimension": "before", "values": ["2020-01-01"] }
      ]
    },
    "cache_revision": "<cache_revision from the explore response>",
    "search_provenance": {}
  },
  "operation_token": "<operation_token from preflight>",
  "description": "old example.com mail"
}
```

The response is the same `201` manifest shape as above, plus `matched_count`
and `skipped_count`:

```json
{
  "dry_run": false,
  "message_count": 2,
  "matched_count": 3,
  "skipped_count": 1,
  "account": "you@gmail.com",
  "source": {"id": 1, "type": "gmail", "identifier": "you@gmail.com"},
  "id": "20260706-153000-old-example-com-mail-a1b2",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

`message_count` is the staged subset, `matched_count` the reviewed match set,
and `skipped_count` the items no source supports deleting. Deletion covers
Gmail-source email, so a mixed selection stages its Gmail rows and reports the
rest as skipped rather than failing; only a selection with nothing deletable
returns `409 selection_not_deletable`. Legacy Gmail rows with a blank
`message_type` count as email.

`selection` cannot be combined with `filter` or `message_ids`
(`400 invalid_request`). The server re-validates the selection against the
preflight grant before staging: the selection, its match count, and the
cache/search revisions must be unchanged. `"dry_run": true` may be combined
with a selection to preview the same staged subset, counts, and sample; the
token is validated but not consumed.

#### Errors

| Status | Code | When |
|---|---|---|
| `400` | `empty_filter` | No filter criterion, `message_ids` entry, or `selection` |
| `400` | `invalid_request` | Unknown JSON fields, or `selection` combined with `filter` / `message_ids` |
| `400` | `invalid_date` | `after` / `before` is not RFC3339 or `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `400` | `no_messages_matched` | The criteria or reviewed selection match nothing |
| `400` | `multi_account_selection` | The selection spans more than one Gmail account |
| `428` | `preflight_required` | Non-dry-run `filter` request without a preflighted selection, or `selection` without `operation_token` |
| `409` | `operation_token_invalid` | Token expired, already used, or does not match the selection, count, and revision |
| `409` | `archive_revision_changed` | The analytical cache changed since preflight |
| `409` | `search_revision_changed` | The search index revision changed since preflight |
| `400` | `invalid_selection_predicate` | The predicate query carries an empty `from` / `to` / `cc` / `bcc` value |
| `409` | `selection_not_deletable` | No item in the selection can be deleted from its source |
| `409` | `selection_changed` | The matching messages changed between preflight and staging |

### List staged deletions {#get-apiv1deletions}

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/deletions`

Lists deletion manifests, newest first. The optional `status` parameter
filters by one of `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `failed`, or
`cancelled`; omitting it returns all statuses.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "manifests": [
    {
      "id": "20260706-153000-old-newsletters-a1b2",
      "status": "pending",
      "created_at": "2026-07-06T15:30:00Z",
      "created_by": "api",
      "description": "old newsletters",
      "message_count": 1234
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Cancel a staged deletion {#delete-apiv1deletionsid}

**Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/v1/deletions/{id}`

Cancels (unstages) a pending or in-progress deletion manifest. Returns `404`
for an unknown manifest ID and `409 not_cancellable` for manifests that are
already completed, failed, or cancelled.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "20260706-153000-old-newsletters-a1b2",
  "status": "cancelled"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

The API enforces rate limiting of 10 requests per second per client IP, with a burst allowance of 20 requests. When the limit is exceeded, the server responds with HTTP 429 and includes a `Retry-After` header indicating how long to wait before retrying.

## CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is disabled by default. To allow browser-based clients, configure allowed origins in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[server]
cors_origins = ["http://localhost:3000", "https://my-dashboard.example.com"]
cors_credentials = true
cors_max_age = 3600
```

## Scheduled Sync

The server can automatically sync Gmail, IMAP, Microsoft Teams, and registered
Discord guild sources on a cron-based schedule. Add `[[accounts]]` sections to
your config:

```toml
[[accounts]]
email = "you@gmail.com"
schedule = "0 * * * *"    # every hour
enabled = true

[[accounts]]
email = "user@example.com"
schedule = "*/15 * * * *" # every 15 minutes
enabled = true

[[accounts]]
email = "123456789012345678" # exact registered Discord guild ID
schedule = "*/30 * * * *"
enabled = true
```

The scheduler starts automatically with `msgvault serve` when account schedules
are configured. Discord schedules require the exact guild ID because display
names are mutable and can be duplicated. Use `/api/v1/scheduler/status` to
monitor schedule state and `/api/v1/sync/{account}` to trigger supported
account syncs outside the schedule. Discord's dedicated manual command is
`msgvault sync-discord`.

The same HTTP server backs configured remote CLI access and the local background daemon used by archive-access CLI commands. In API schema 2.4.0, the CLI sync transport accepts `source_id`, allowing `sync` and `sync-full` to select one source exactly even when several source types share an identifier.

!!! note
    Gmail accounts must have completed an initial `msgvault sync-full` before
    scheduled incremental sync. IMAP schedules scan the mailbox and skip known
    messages. Teams and Discord importers detect and checkpoint their own
    first-run history backfills.

`msgvault serve` also runs scheduled SyncTech SMS Backup & Restore Drive sources configured under `[[synctech_sms.sources]]`; see [Configuration](/docs/configuration/#synctech-sms-sources).

## Security Model

The server is designed for local use:

- **Loopback-only by default.** The default bind address is `127.0.0.1`, restricting access to the local machine.
- **API key required for non-loopback.** If you bind to a non-loopback address (e.g., `0.0.0.0`), the server requires `api_key` to be set and will refuse to start without it.
- **Opt-in for insecure binding.** To bind to a non-loopback address without an API key (not recommended), set `allow_insecure = true`.

!!! warning
    Exposing the server on a network without authentication gives anyone on that network access to your entire email archive. Always set an `api_key` when binding to non-loopback addresses.

## Configuration Reference

All server settings go in the `[server]` section of `config.toml`. Account schedules use `[[accounts]]` sections.

### `[server]`

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `api_port` | `0` (auto-select) | Port the server listens on; `0` picks an open port at startup and clients discover it automatically. Set a fixed port for remote/NAS deployments. |
| `bind_addr` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address |
| `api_key` | — | API key for authentication |
| `agent_access` | `false` | Enable restricted agent grants; requires a non-empty `api_key` and a daemon restart after changes |
| `allow_insecure` | `false` | Allow non-loopback binding without `api_key` |
| `cors_origins` | `[]` | Allowed CORS origins |
| `cors_credentials` | `false` | Allow credentials in CORS requests |
| `cors_max_age` | `0` | CORS preflight cache duration in seconds (defaults to `86400` when `cors_origins` is set) |
| `trusted_proxies` | `[]` | IP addresses or CIDRs allowed to supply forwarded HTTPS and host headers |
| `daemon_idle_timeout` | `20m` | Idle timeout for lifecycle-managed background daemons; set to `"0s"` to disable |
| `daemon_auto_restart` | `newer` | Local daemon restart policy when the CLI finds a different daemon binary version: `newer`, `never`, or `always` |
| `daemon_auto_start` | `true` | Let CLI, TUI, and MCP commands start a local background daemon when none is running; set `false` when a supervisor runs `msgvault serve` |

`daemon_idle_timeout` only affects daemons started by `msgvault daemon start` or auto-started by a CLI command. A foreground `msgvault serve` runs until interrupted. `MSGVAULT_DAEMON_IDLE_TIMEOUT` can override the configured timeout for lifecycle-managed background daemons.

`daemon_auto_restart` only affects local lifecycle-managed daemons. The default `newer` replaces older compatible daemons with the current CLI binary, `never` leaves restarts to an external supervisor, and `always` restarts on any safe version mismatch. Remote servers are never restarted by CLI clients.

### `[analytics]`

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `engine` | `auto` | Aggregate engine for Web UI, TUI, and aggregate HTTP views: `auto`, `sql`, or `duckdb` |
| `auto_build_cache` | `true` | Build stale or missing Parquet cache files during daemon startup and after scheduled syncs; `false` skips both automatic paths |
| `min_rebuild_interval` | `0s` | Minimum age of a usable cache before a scheduled sync or daemon restart may rebuild it; zero preserves rebuilding after each sync |
| `builder_memory_limit` | `2GB` | DuckDB memory limit for cache builds, such as `4GB` or `512MiB` |
| `builder_threads` | min(CPUs, 2) | DuckDB threads for cache builds; zero keeps the default |
| `builder_temp_limit` | `32GB` | Maximum spill-to-disk size for cache builds |
| `query_memory_limit` | `512MB` | DuckDB memory limit for daemon aggregate queries; raise it on a large archive |
| `query_threads` | min(CPUs, 4) | DuckDB threads for daemon aggregate queries; zero keeps the default |
| `query_temp_limit` | `2GB` | Maximum spill-to-disk size for daemon aggregate queries; a query that spills past it fails with a DuckDB out-of-memory error |

`engine = "sql"` forces live SQL for aggregate views. `engine = "duckdb"`
requires a usable Parquet cache and keeps analytics unavailable until it is
ready. Startup fails if no usable cache can be built or opened. A failed
automatic refresh keeps the last usable publication available.
`auto_build_cache = false` leaves cache rebuilds to explicit
`msgvault build-cache` runs. These settings replace the TUI/MCP analytics flags
deprecated in 0.17.0; see [Configuration: analytics](/docs/configuration/#analytics).

`min_rebuild_interval` limits automatic rebuilds after syncs and at daemon
startup; a restart within the interval serves the existing publication.
The interval also applies to usable partial snapshots that need a full rebuild.
Explicit builds, query-required builds, and unusable-cache recovery remain
immediate. On a continuously changing archive, Parquet analytics can lag
SQLite by approximately the interval plus cache build time. Cache builder memory
and temporary disk usage scale with archive size, so the interval can prevent
repeated archive-scale work on frequently synced archives. Changes under
`[analytics]` take effect after the daemon restarts.
