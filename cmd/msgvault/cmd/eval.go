var evalCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "eval",
	Short: "Score search quality against relevance judgments (qrels)",
	Long: `Measure retrieval quality over a set of labeled queries.

Runs each topic through one or more search modes (fts, vector, hybrid) against
the local archive and scores the ranking against relevance judgments using
standard IR metrics: precision@10, nDCG@10, recall@100, MAP and MRR. This makes
the effect of an indexing, embedding, or fusion change measurable rather than
guessed. MAP and MRR are reported as MAP@n / MRR@n: they take no cutoff of
their own, but the ranking they score stops at -n, so a relevant message below
that rank is as invisible to them as it is to recall.

Inputs (TREC-style):
  --qrels   judgments file, one per line: "<qid> <iter> <docid> <rel>"
            (rel >= 1 means relevant; the iter column is ignored)
  --topics  queries file, tab-separated: "<qid>\t<query text>[\t<category>]"
            Each qid must appear once — it is the join key to --qrels, so a
            repeat would score the same judgments twice and weight that query
            twice over in every average; the file is rejected instead.
            The optional third column labels the question's shape (e.g.
            "pointed" for answerable-from-one-message, "spanning" for
            requires-synthesizing-across-messages); when present, results
            are also broken down per category. Two-column files work as-is.

Doc ids in --qrels are matched against each message's source_message_id by
default (--doc-key=message), or its conversation's source_conversation_id
(--doc-key=conversation). Pick the one your judgments actually reference: an
mbox import, for example, keys each imported document by conversation, so
message-keyed qrels would score a flat zero against it. When the judged unit
is the conversation, a thread is counted once, at its best-ranked message —
and retrieval over-fetches messages so that -n really does yield up to n
distinct threads. Reported latency therefore includes that over-fetch.

Both ids are assigned by the source and are unique only within it, while a
qrels doc id records no source at all. A run therefore stops before scoring
anything if the archive holds an id shared by two connected accounts: merging
two accounts' documents under one key would let an unjudged account's message
inherit a judged one's relevance. Accounts with disjoint id spaces (a mailbox
and a chat archive, say) score normally.

Metric depths follow -n: the standard P@10 / nDCG@10 / R@100 are reported when
the run retrieves at least that deep, and are clamped to -n below it (a run
that only ever looks 20 deep has no recall@100, and labelling one would invite
a false comparison). MAP and MRR are always at -n, since the truncated ranking
is the whole of what they see. The column headers always name the depth
actually used.

Each mode runs the same code production search runs. fts is the
relevance-ranked (BM25, subject-weighted) store path behind
/api/v1/search?mode=fts — not a chronological listing — so it honours the same
deletion scope and the same substring address-filter semantics real searches
do; vector and hybrid go through the hybrid engine with the fusion parameters
from your config. Query embedding follows [vector.embeddings] api_format, so an
index built through the Voyage contextual endpoint is queried through it too —
comparing "voyage-context-4" against an OpenAI-compatible model is a matter of
pointing the command at each config in turn.

Every run reports the embedding model, api format, index settings and index
size that produced it, plus per-query latency, because a quality number is not
comparable — or even interpretable — without them. Those numbers describe what
was searched, not what merely exists: the corpus count covers live messages
only (dedup-hidden duplicates and messages deleted from their source account
are excluded, as they are from every search here), and the vector count covers
the active generation only, not the retired ones vectors.db still holds. That
generation is resolved once at the start of the run; each query still searches
whatever is active at query time, so a rebuild or activation you trigger while
an eval is in flight can leave the reported vector count stale for topics
scored after the swap.
Anything that went wrong without being fatal — unparseable judgment lines,
topics whose query string did not parse or parsed to no search criteria at
all, hits that could not be hydrated from the archive, rankings cut short by
the fusion pool, topics no mode could score — is reported under "Diagnostics"
rather than silently folded into the scores. So is partial qrels coverage: a
topic the judgments never mention cannot be scored, and the diagnostics say
how many of the topics file that leaves the headline numbers standing on.

Note on topic phrasing: it is an experimental variable, not a constant. FTS5
matches on AND semantics, so a verbose natural-language topic requires every
one of its words to appear in a message and will usually score near zero,
while its keyword reduction scores well. Dense retrieval can move the other
way. Compare runs only across the same topics file.

// requireDisjointSourceIDs refuses a run whose archive cannot give the chosen

//
// A qrels file is flat. "<qid> <iter> <docid> <rel>" has nowhere to record
// which connected account <docid> belongs to, and neither a TREC-derived
// collection nor judgments written by hand against a personal archive carry
// one. But both ids this command can key on are assigned by the *source* —
// source_message_id by the provider or the sending mail system,
// source_conversation_id by the provider's threading — and are unique only
// within it. msgvault is a multi-source archiver, so one archive routinely
// holds several accounts, and two of them can issue the same id for unrelated
// documents (two chat accounts each numbering their first conversation "1") or
// for related ones (the same mail delivered to two mailboxes). Either way the
// eval folds two documents into one key: a hit from an unjudged account
// inherits a judged account's relevance, or two genuinely distinct documents
// collapse and the ranking quietly loses a rank. Both move the score, both move
// it upward, and neither appears anywhere in the output — which is exactly the
// class of silent corruption this command exists to expose in other people's
// indexes.
//
// The fix is a precondition rather than a new key shape. Composing the source
// id into the key — as query.EntryKeyFacts.EntryKey does for explore entries,
// production's own answer to the same uniqueness problem — would make the key
// sound, but it would also change the shape of every doc id this command
// matches on, so every qrels file already written would stop matching. And it
// would stop matching by scoring a flat zero rather than by failing, which is
// the same silent corruption one level up.
//
// The precondition is disjointness, not single-source. An archive holding a
// Gmail account and a WhatsApp account has two sources and no overlapping ids
// at all; refusing to score it would be a wall built for a hazard that is not
// there. What has to hold is that the id space the qrels address is
// unambiguous, and "no id in it names documents in two sources" is exactly
// that. It is a property of the archive rather than of what a particular topic
// happened to retrieve, so it is established once, up front, instead of
// inferred from hits that may simply have got lucky — and it is established
// before the vector path is opened, so a run that cannot be scored does not
// first pay for an index and an embedding client.
